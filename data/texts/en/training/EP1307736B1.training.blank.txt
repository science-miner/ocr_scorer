Background Art 

[0002] Natural proteins differ from most polymers in that they predominantly populate a single, ordered three-dimen-
sional structure in solution. It has long been recognized that this ordered structure can be transformed to an approximate 
random chain by changes in temperature, pressure or solvent conditions (Neurath et al., (1944) Chem. Rev. 34: 157-265). 
The ability to induce protein unfolding, and subsequent refolding, has allowed scientists to analyze the physical chemistry 
of the folding reaction in vitro (Schellman, (1987) Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bio. 16: 115-37). These investigations have shed 
light on the kinetics and thermodynamics of conformational changes in proteins and are of biological interest for two 
important reasons. First, they aid in the understanding of how proteins, which start their existence in the cell in a disordered 
state, manage to rapidly transform into a single, folded, functional conformation. Second, they elucidate the nature of 
functionally significant structural fluctuations present in proteins once folding equilibrium is reached. 
[0003] The function of a protein is contingent on the stability of its native conformation. Consequently, in the field of 
protein biochemistry, stability measurements are frequently performed to establish a polypeptide as a stably folded 
protein and to study the physical forces that lead to its folding (Schellman, (1987) Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bio. 16: 115-37). 
Stability measurements also provide important biological information; a decrease in stability can be a sign of misfolding, 
which in some proteins leads to disease (Dobson, (1999) Trends Biochem. Sci. 24: 329-32) while an increase in stability 
can be indicative of ligand binding (Schellman, (1975) Biopolymers 14: 999-1018). Despite their utility, stability meas-
urements currently necessitate time-consuming experiments with pure protein samples. In proteomic experiments (Black-
stock &amp; Weir, (1999) Trends Biotechnol. 17: 121-27), where a large number of polypeptides often need to be analyzed, 
stability measurements are not practical. 
[0004] Recent studies have demonstrated that hydrogen exchange coupled with electrospray ionization (ESI) mass 
spectrometry can qualitatively distinguish native-like proteins from unfolded polypeptides in partially purified samples 
(Rosenbaum et al., (1999) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 121: 9509-13) and can be used to study the kinetics and thermodynamics 
of folding (Miranker et al., (1996) FASEB J. 10: 93-101; Deng &amp; Smith, (1999) Anal. Biochem. 276: 150-60). However, 
these studies did not disclose the quantitative analysis of native-like proteins. 
[0005] Stability measurements are frequently performed to establish a polypeptide as a stably folded protein and to 
study the forces that lead to its folding. Conventional denaturation methods used for the analysis of protein stability have 
at least the following identified experimental limitations: 1) stability can only be measured under conditions where the 
protein is partially unfolded; 2) the energetics of localized fluctuations can not be easily measured; 3) many proteins 
cannot be analyzed because they aggregate during the course of denaturation; 4) stability measurements cannot be 
obtained in complex mixtures, extracts or living cells; 5) relatively large amounts of protein are required for analysis; and

6) denaturation experiments are tirrie-consuming and not amenable to high-throughput analysis. These constraints 
drastically limit the number of biological problems that can be addressed through stability measurements. 
[0006] Thermodynamic stability is an important biological property that has evolved to an optimal level to fit the functional 
needs of proteins. Therefore, investigating the stability of proteins is important not only because it affords information 
about the physical chemistry of folding, but also because it can provide important biological insights. A proper under-
standing of protein stability is also useful for technological purposes. The ability to rationally make proteins of high 
stability, low aggregation or low degradation rates will be valuable for a number of applications. For example, proteins 
that can resist unfolding can be used in industrial processes that require enzyme catalysis at high temperatures (Van 
den Burg et al., (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 95 (5): 2056-60); and the ability to produce proteins with low 
degradation rates within the cell can help to maximize production of recombinant proteins (Kwon et al., (1996) Protein 
Eng. 9 (12): 1197-202). 
[0007] Stability measurements can also be used as probes of other biolological phenomena. The most basic of these 
phenomena is biological activity. The ability of proteins to populate their native states is a universal requirement for 
function. Therefore, stability can be used as a convenient, first level assay for function. For example, libraries of polypep-
tide sequences can be tested for stability in order to select for sequences that fold into stable conformations and might 
potentially be active (Sandberg et al., (1995) Biochem. 34: 11970-78). 
[0008] Changes in stability can also be used to detect binding. When a ligand binds to the native conformation of a 
protein, the global stability of a protein is increased (Schellman, (1975) Biopolymers 14: 999-1018; Pace &amp; McGrath, 
(1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255: 3862-65; Pace &amp; Grimsley, (1988) Biochem. 27: 3242-46). The binding constant can be 
measured by analyzing the extent of the stability increase. This strategy has been used to analyze the binding of ions 
and small molecules to a number of proteins (Pace &amp; McGrath, (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255: 3862-65; Pace &amp; Grimsley, 
(1988) Biochem. 27: 3242-46; Schwartz, (1988) Biochem. 27: 8429-36; Brandts &amp; Lin, (1990) Biochem. 29: 6927-40; 
Straume &amp; Freire, (1992) Anal. Biochem. 203: 259-68; Graziano et al., (1996) Biochem. 35: 13386-92; Kanaya et al., 
(1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271: 32729-36). 
[0009] The linkage between stability and binding has recently been implemented as a method to detect ligand binding 
(U.S. Patent No 5,679,582 to Bowie &amp; Pakula). This method, however, does not take advantage of the high sensitivity 
available from an analytical technique such as MALDI mass spectrometry, and cannot be employed at the low protein 
levels that MALDI mass spectrometry can detect. Moreover, proteolytic methods can require additional steps to isolate 
and analyze proteolytic fragments and cannot be performed in an in vivo setting. Finally, this method cannot be employed 
to generate quantitative measurements of protein stability. 
[0010] Deng et al., J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spec, vol. 10 (5), pp. 675-684 disclose results of a comparison study of continuous 
and pulsed labeling of unfolding peptides using mass spectrometry (MS) for studies of protein dynamics. The document 
teaches a procedure for studying unfolding kinetics of proteins that includes incubating the studied protein in a single 
high concentration of urea (3M), which denatures the studied peptide over time. See p. 676, 3 rd paragraph; p. 677, and 
Figure 2. This document teaches measuring unfolding kinetics by tracking H/D exchange as a function of time and only 
at a single denaturant concentration. See p. 679, column 1 and Figures 4, 6, and 7. It does not teach or suggest varying 
the denaturant concentration and determining protein stability based on the change in mass of the test protein as a 
function of the change in denaturant concentration. 
[0011] PCT International Publication No. WO 99/09204 teaches methods of determining with high-resolution peptide 
amide groups that are solvent accessible for mapping binding sites/ surfaces, and/or studying conformational changes 
in a polypeptide. See the Abstract. The document teaches deuterium exchange measurements for determining regions 
of a protein or fragment thereof that are accessible to the solvent, and therefore potential binding sites. See p. 49-51. 
However, the document, does not teach or suggest varying the denaturant concentration and determining protein stability 
based on the change in mass of the test protein as a function of the change in denaturant concentration. 
[0012] Villanueva et al., FEBS Letters, vol. 472 (1), pp. 27-33, teach using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization 
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to monitor hydrogen exchange of entire proteins as a function of 
time, particularly with regard to "slow exchange" hydrogens. The document further teaches using MALDI-TOF MS to 
check the folding state of a protein. See p. 27, second column. However, the document does not provide any teaching 
or suggestion of denaturing the proteins measured. As such, the document also does not teach varying the denaturant 
concentration and determining protein stability based on the change in mass of the test protein as a function of the 
change in denaturant concentration. 
[0013] Thus, there remains substantial room for improvement in existing methods of screening for, quantitatively 
determining and beneficially employing protein stability measurements. A particularly desirable method would provide 
for the high throughput quantitative determination of protein stability, would require only very small quantities of sample, 
would permit in vivo measurement of protein stability and would generate data useful for a variety of stability-based 
applications. Until the disclosure of the present invention set forth herein, such a method was not available in the art.

Detailed Description of the Invention 

MALDI MS-HX METHODS 

[0022] In accordance with the present invention, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization (MALDI) mass spectrom-
etry is used to detect hydrogen/ deuterium exchange. The MALDI technique is tolerant of impure samples that contain 
moderate levels of salts and other small molecule contaminants (Beavis &amp; Chait, (1996) Method. Enzmol. 270: 519-51). 
Additionally, MALDI is adaptable to fast, high throughput screening because a large number of samples can be analyzed 
in a short period of time. Furthermore, MALDI is a very sensitive technique and can be used to study very small quantities 
of sample. These features make MALDI-based methods well suited for the measurement of hydrogen exchange as a 
function of denaturant concentration to give a quantitative measurement of the protein stability. 
[0023] In one aspect of the present invention, the co-inventors disclose the use of hydrogen exchange as detected 
by mass spectrometry (MALDI MS-HX) to measure stabilities. In another aspect of the present invention, novel hydrogen 
exchange methodologies for examining MS-HX exchange data as applied to the stability of proteins in a number of 
biological applications are disclosed. In MS-HX, an observed hydrogen-deuterium exchange represents exchange of 
the entire protein rather than individual hydrogens. The disclosure of the present invention demonstrates that MS-HX 
kinetics, preferably as a function of denaturant concentration, contains sufficient information to measure the stabilities 
(including the global stability) of a test protein. The MALDI MS-HX data disclosed herein for λ 6-85 variants is representative 
of this approach. The methods disclosed herein can be used to interpret the MALDI MS-HX data for virtually any protein. 
A MALDI-based MS-HX technique to rapidly measure stabilities (which can comprise samples disposed in or comprising 
crude cell lysates), examine protein-protein interactions and examine the stability of proteins in vivo (e.g. within the 
cytoplasm of a cell such as E. coli) is additionally disclosed. 
[0024] As an aspect of the present invention, a MALDI MS-HX method is disclosed. Generally, when employing the 
MALDI MS-HX method, one or more test proteins are subjected to hydrogen-deuterium (H/D) exchange by dilution into 
a series of deuterated exchange buffers containing different concentrations of denaturant, preferably ranging from 0 to 
8 M, and including but not limited to 0.5M, 1.0M, 1.5M, 2.0M, 2.5M, 3.0M, 3.5M, 4.0M, 4.5M, 5.0M, 5.5M, 6.0M, 6.5M, 
7.0M, and 7.5M denaturant concentrations. Representative denaturants can include, but are not limited to, guanidinium 
chloride, urea and detergents, and the like. The chemical denaturant has the effect of destabilizing the test protein's 
structure, which in turn has the effect of increasing the rate of global H/D exchange and increasing the rate of deuterium 
incorporation into the test protein at positions occupied by hydrogen atoms in the native test protein. After a specified 
exchange period (e.g. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 70, 80, or 120 minutes) the deuterium content of the 
test protein sample (s) is the determined using MALDI mass spectrometry. The change in the mass of the protein (∆Mass) 
measurements recorded by MALDI in the MALDI MS-HX experiment only include those deuterated sites in the protein 
(s) that do not re-exchange during MALDI sample preparation. These sites are comprise, and are usually restricted to, 
those in the amide backbone of the protein because they have the slowest intrinsic exchange rates among the group of 
exchangeable hydrogens of a protein. Any back-exchange reaction that occur during MALDI sample preparation does 
not interfere with the analysis of the MALDI MS-HX data. Ultimately, the change in mass relative to the fully protonated 
sample is plotted as a function of denaturant concentration [Denat.] and the data are fit to the MALDI MS-HX equation: 
∆Mass = ∆M ∞ + (∆M 0 -∆M ∞ ) e -(&lt;kint&gt;/(1+Kfold))t , where K fold = e -(∆Gf + m[Denat.]/RT) , a derivation and detailed treatment of 

which is another aspect of the present invention and disclosed herein below. 

SUPREX METHODS 

[0025] As noted above and described further herein below, the methods of the present invention can be employed to 
study the stability of various unpurified samples (e.g. crude lysates). In this embodiment of the invention, the MALDI 
MS-HX method is denoted SUPREX (stability of unpurified proteins from rates of H/D exchange), further identifying its 


EP 1 307 736 B1

application to unpurified samples. Thus, the methods of the present invention are generally denoted throughout the 
present disclosure as MALDI MS-HX; when unpurified samples are studied the MALDI MS-HX method is denoted 
SUPREX. It will be recognized that SUPREX is only one aspect of the MALDI MS-HX methods of the present invention. 
Additional MALDI MS-HX methods are disclosed herein. 
[0026] The methods of the present invention provide the ability to rapidly screen a large number of protein samples 
for the presence of stable structure. In a preferred embodiment, the method uses hydrogen exchange coupled with 
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry to obtain quantitative measurements of stability 
from crude extracts (e.g. recombinant E. coli cultures grown in 96 well microtiter plates). In this embodiment, the method 
is referred to as SUPREX, reflecting its ability to tolerate unpurified samples. 
[0027] Thus, with the methods disclosed herein, researchers can, for example, determine the stability (to within 0.5 
kcal/mol) of proteins expressed in 200 microliter cultures grown, for example, in single wells of a 96 well plate. Researchers 
can also use the methods disclosed herein to determine whether a protein is stably folded under the conditions of a 
particular experiment to characterize its structure and/or function. Moreover, researchers can employ the methods 
disclosed herein characterize aggregated proteins not amenable to conventional biochemical assays; and identify small 
or large molecules that bind to a protein of interest by virtue of the effect of binding on protein stability.

III. General Considerations 

[0053] Within a polypeptide, certain labile hydrogen atoms can exchange freely with the surrounding solvent. Native 
structure protects a subset of these hydrogens from exchange (Hvidt &amp; Nielson, (1996) Adv. Protein Chem. 21: 287-386), 
and some of these protected protons exchange only if the protein globally unfolds (Englander et al., (1996) Curr. Opin. 
Struct. Biol. 6: 18-23). The stability of a protein can be analyzed by monitoring the exchange rates of these "globally 
protected" hydrogens (Huyghues-Despointes et al., (1999) Nat. Struct. Biol. 6: 910-12). Protein hydrogen exchange 
rates are typically measured by allowing labile protons to exchange with D 2 O. The proton/ deuteron exchange reaction 
is commonly measured by monitoring exchange via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods (Englander et al., 
(1996) Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 6: 18-23). 
[0054] NMR has drawbacks when monitoring H/D exchange, however. These drawbacks can be compensated for by 
employing other analytical techniques, such as mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry in particular is experimentally 
more convenient than NMR for many reasons. For example, mass spectrometery requires less protein than NMR, it is 
faster and simpler to use than NMR, it does not require complicated spectral assignments like those demanded by NMR 
and it does not require pure protein samples. Additionally, it is well-known that a limitation of NMR applications in 
biochemical research is its need for large quantities of sample. 

IV. The Theoretical Basis for the Mass Spectrometry-detected Hydrogen Exchange (MS-HX) Methods 

[0055] While it is not the desire of the present co-inventors to be bound by a specific theory of operation of the present 
invention, in the following section, a theoretical basis for the methods disclosed in the present invention is presented. 
The theoretical basis comprises a derivation of relationships correlating a change in mass of a sample (e.g. a test protein) 
with its stability. The following derivation forms a theoretical basis of the MALDI MS-HX methods of the present invention 
generally, and the SUPREX methods of the present invention particularly. 

IV.A. Overall Theoretical Approach to the MS-detected Hydrogen Exchange (MS-HX) and SUPREX Techniques 

[0056] The thermodynamic stability (∆G unfold ) of proteins is commonly measured by denaturation experiments that 
use chemicals or temperature to unfold proteins (Schellman, (1987) Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 16: 115-137). Resulting 
denaturation curves can be converted to stability measurements using two-state extrapolation models (Pace, (1986) 
Method Enzymol. 131: 266-80). Extrapolation to ambient conditions is required as ∆G unfold can be measured during the 
transition phase of the denaturation experiment. 
[0057] Another method commonly used to examine the thermodynamics of protein folding is native state hydrogen 
exchange (HX) (Bai et al., (1994) Proteins 20: 4-14). The ability of HX to measure extremely large unfolding equilibrium 
constants has long been recognized (Hvidt &amp; Nielson, (1966) Adv. Prot. Chem. 21: 287-386). HX can measure stabilities 
under conditions where the protein is primarily folded. Two techniques that can be used to detect HX are NMR and mass 
spectrometry (Englander et al., (1996) Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 6: 18-23; Miranker et al., (1996) FASEB J. 10: 93-101). 

IV.B. Hydrogen/ Deterium Exchange, Generally 

[0058] Certain hydrogen atoms within a polypeptide can exchange with the surrounding solvent. When a protein is 
placed in D 2 O a fraction of its protons, including the amide hydrogens (NH), will be replaced by deuterons over time. In 
the native structure of a protein some of the NHs are protected from exchange either because they are involved in 
hydrogen bonds or because they are not solvent accessible (Bai &amp; Englander, (1996) Proteins 24: 145-51; Englander 
et al., (1996) Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 6: 18-23; Clarke &amp; Itzhaki, (1998) Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 8: 112-18). For these 
protected NHs, the exchange reaction is slow in comparison to their counterparts in unfolded polypeptides. The exchange 
of protected NHs can be analyzed based on the following model (Hvidt &amp; Nielson, (1966) Adv. Protein Chem. 21: 287-386): 


EP 1 307 736 B1 

12 

5 





















where NH closed and NH open are the conformations of the protein in which given NHs are incompetent or competent to 
exchange respectively, K open is the equilibrium constant for the opening reaction and k int is the intrinsic rate constant of 
the exchange reaction. Under normal physiological conditions, the opening reaction is usually in a rapid pre-equilibrium 
with respect to the exchange reaction (EX2 regime) and the observed rate constant (k ex ) is proportional to K open . For a 
given amide hydrogen, there can exist multiple opening mechanisms (Mayo &amp; Baldwin, (1993) Science 262: 873-76; 
Bai et al., (1995) Science 269: 192-97). 
[0059] Two types of mechanisms that have been observed for all proteins studied to date are the "local opening" and 
"global opening" mechanisms. Global opening mechanisms involve the unfolding of the entire protein. Under this mech-
anism, the opening equilibrium constant is equivalent to the global unfolding equilibrium constant as would be measured 
by traditional denaturation experiments. The possible conformational changes responsible for local opening are still 
debated (Miller &amp; Dill, (1995) Protein Sci. 4: 1860-73; Bai &amp; Englander, (1996) Proteins 24: 145-51; Li &amp; Woodward, 
(1999) Protein Sci. 8: 1571-90). Local opening equilibrium constants for an NH are probably affected by both the stability 
of its localized region in the protein and its solvent accessibility. A number of proteins also demonstrate a third, sub-
global mechanism of exchange through partially unfolded intermediates (Bai et al., (1995) Science 269: 192-97; Raschke 
&amp; Marqusee, (1997) Nat. Struct Biol. 4: 298-304). 
[0060] Under a given set of conditions, an NH can exchange through any of the above mechanisms. If the exchange 
is occurring through the global mechanism then the observed exchange rate is related to the global stability of the protein. 
On the other hand, if the exchange is occurring through sub-global or local mechanisms, then the observed exchange 
rate is reporting on the stability of the folding intermediate (s) in which the NH is open to exchange or the exchange 
characteristics of the local environment of the NH in the folded conformation. By conducting exchange as a function of 
denaturant concentration (an aspect of the present invention) or temperature researchers can decipher the contribution 
of each mechanism to the exchange rate of a given hydrogen (Mayo &amp; Baldwin, (1993) Science 262: 873-76; Bai et al., 
(1995) Science 269: 192-97; Raschke &amp; Marqusee, (1997) Nat. Struct. Biol. 4: 298-304). Thus exchange experiments 
can be used to measure global stability, thermodynamics of intermediates and local dynamics of specific regions in the 
protein. 

IV.C. Derivation of MALDI MS-HX and Relationships 

[0061] According to the classical hydrogen exchange model (Hvidt &amp; Nielson, (1966) Adv. Protein Chem. 21: 287-386): 

where k ex is the observed exchange rate for each hydrogen, k open and k close are the rate constants for the conformational 
changes leading to exchange competent and exchange incompetent states respectively and k int is the exchange rate 
for the unprotected hydrogen. 
[0062] Under EX2 conditions (where k close (or k open ) are much greater than k int : 

where K open is the equilibrium constant between the exchange competent and exchange incompetent conformations of 
the protein (k open /k close ). 
[0063] For the hydrogens that are exchanging through a global unfolding mechanism: 

[0064] Substituting (3) into (2): 


EP 1 307 736 B1 

13 

5 





















Since k int is similar among the majority of the backbone amide hydrogens (Bai et al., (1993) Proteins 17: 75-86), the 
total exchange of the hydrogens that exchange through global unfolding can be estimated by a single rate constant. The 
increase in mass due to the exchange of globally exchanging protons (∆Mass) as a function of time can thus be estimated 
by the following first order rate equation: 

where ∆M o is ∆Mass before global exchange, ∆M ∞ is ∆Mass after complete exchange and t is the exchange time. 
Substitution of Equation (4) into Equation (5) gives an equation for ∆Mass vs ∆ [Denat.]: 

where (Pace, (1986) Method Enzymol. 131: 266-80): 

[0065] Summarily, Equations (6) and (7) embody a relationship correlating an observed change in mass (∆Mass) with 
the stability of a sample (∆G f ). Interestingly, this relationship ties together an observed physical change in a sample, an 
observed increase in mass, with a thermodynamic property, stability, as represented by the term ∆G f . 

[0066] 
(6) 
(7), ∆G f is the free energy of folding in the absence of denaturant, [Denat.] is the 

denatruant concentration, m is δ∆G f / δ [Denat.], R is the gas constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin. The m value 

determines the sharpness of the transition in the ∆Mass vs [Denat.] plot. 
[0067] Myers et al. have shown that m values can be estimated from the size of the protein (Myers et al., (1995) 
Protein Sci. 4: 2138-48). The average denaturant m value per residue for the 34 proteins in Table 1 of Myers et al. is 
26 (pH = 7.2) cal mol -1 M -1 per residue. According to this analysis, MBP and λ 6-85 are predicted to have m values of 9.7 
2.6 and 2.1 0.6 kcal mol -1 M -1 . These measurements are close to the previously reported experimental m values 
(12 1 and 2.1 0.1 kcal mol -1 M -1 , respectively) measured from CD denaturation curves (Ghaemmaghami et al., 
(1998) Biochem. 37: 9179-85; Sheshadri et al., (1999) Protein Sci. 8: 1689-95). In order to assess the error involved in 
using estimated m values, as would be the case in a high-throughput screen of proteins, the calculated m values were 
used in this analysis. In Equation (6), &lt;k int &gt; is the average exchange rate of unprotected amide hydrogens and is a 
function of pH and temperature. In principle, &lt;k int &gt; can be estimated by averaging the values for all the backbone amide 
hydrogens using the measurements of Englander et al. (Bai et al., (1993) Proteins 17: 75-86). However, for these studies, 
the simple relationship &lt;k int &gt;=10 pH-5 min -1 was used to estimate the rate at room temperature and pH &gt; 4. 
[0068] Thus, Equation (6) relates denaturant concentration with the mass of a sample. This equation is a link between 
mass spectrometry data and the denaturant. The degree of unfolding of a protein is dependent upon the denaturant 
concentration (a factor that is present in Equation (6) via Equation (7)) and thus, the mass of a sample can be correlated 
with a degree of unfolding, stability and other properties. Equation (6) represents one aspect of the present invention, 
and facilitates the quantitative determination of a protein's stability and, under a given set of conditions, its state of 
denaturation. 
[0069] The above theoretical basis applies generally to the MALDI MS-HX and SUPREX methods of the present 
invention. However, it should be noted that the stability curves obtained from MALDI MS-HX and SUPREX analysis 
(depicted in Figures 3B and 4 and described in detail herein below) are not identical to conventional denaturation curves, 
such as those generated by circular dichroism (CD) or other method. The midpoint of transition in conventional dena-
turation curves are a function of the stability and the m value of the protein. In the MALDI MS-HX and SUPREX curves, 
the midpoint is not only a function of these parameters but also depends on the time of exchange (t) and &lt;k int &gt;.

curves respectively and &lt;k int &gt; is itself a function of pH and temperature (Bai et al., (1993) Proteins 17: 75-86). As Equation 
(8) demonstrates, a SUPREX curve can be shifted to the left relative to a conventional denaturation curve, since &lt;k int &gt;t 
is always much greater than 0.693 (the numerical value of In2). 
[0070] Under the conditions used for the experiments described herein, this effect shifts the SUPREX curves of MBP 
and λ 6-85 by 0.5 and 2.4 M, respectively. Those of skill in the art will, therefore, recognize that the value of C 1/2 

SUPREX 

can be purposely altered by changing the pH, temperature, or exchange interval ("t"). High stabilities can be measured 
at higher pH and/or temperature, low stabilities at lower pH and/or temperature. Additionally, the exchange interval can 
conveniently range from a few minutes to hours. For example, according to Equation (8), the midpoint of the SUPREX 
curve for λ 6-85 can be shifted to the right by 1 M relative to the curves shown in Figures 4A-4H by changing the pH to 
5.9 and the exchange time to 11 minutes. In Figures 4A-4H, the curves are arranged in order of the stability of the mutant, 
from the least to the most stable: (A) A66G; (B) A63G; (C) WT; (D) G46A/G48A/A66G; (E) G46A/G48A/A49G; (F) Q33Y; 
(G) G46A/G48A; (H) Q33Y/G46A/G48A. This sort of adjustment makes SUPREX very flexible for measurements over 
a wide range of stabilities. 

V. In Vivo Measurements of Protein Stability 

[0071] Although stability is an important functional property, it has not been previously possible to quantitatively meas-
ure this property directly in vivo. Instead, researchers commonly assume that in vitro stability measurements are appli-
cable in vivo, or use in vivo activity measurements as a qualitative probe of stability. One problem with currently available 
systems is that the complex milieu of molecules present in vivo can affect thermodynamic stability through changes in 
local osmolarity (Yancey et al., (1982) Science 217: 1214-22), oxidation potential (Frand et al., (2000) Trends Cell. Biol. 
10: 203-10) and ligand concentration (Pace &amp; McGrath, (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255: 3862-65). A contingent problem with 
latter approach is that factors other than stability can influence activity (Sandberg et al., (1995) Biochem. 34: 11970-78). 
[0072] In one aspect of the present invention, the methods of the present invention can be employed to directly and 
quantitatively measure the thermodynamic stability of proteins in vivo using hydrogen exchange detected by MALDI 
mass spectrometry. As an illustrative example, the in vivo methods of the present invention are capable of measuring 
the stability of proteins in the cytoplasm of viable cells (e.g. viable E. coli cells). In another example, the in vivo methods 
of the present invention can be employed to compare the in vivo stability of a protein (e.g. the monomeric λ repressor 
(λ 6-85 )) with its in vitro stability under various conditions. 

V.A. Preparation of In Vivo Test Protein Samples 

[0073] Any protein of interest can be studied using the in vivo methods of the present invention. The following discussion 
will, therefore, be applicable mutatis mutandis to any protein of interest. Initially, a protein of interest disposed in a system 
can be provided by expressing it (preferably overexpressing it) in E. coli or other system, using a T7 or other vector. 
The bacteria or other system is grown in H 2 O-based media. Methods of cloning and expressing a gene in bacteria and 
other systems are well known (see Sambrook et al., (1992) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, 
New York) and will be apparent to those of skill in the art. Thus, the process of providing a test protein disposed in a 
system can vary with the system (e.g. bacteria, tissue, etc), and modifications of the general methods of preparing such 
a system will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon consideration of the present disclosure. Purely for illustrative 
purposes, the system referred to in the following discussion of in vivo methods is bacteria. However, the disclosed in 
vivo methods are not limited to bacterial systems. 
[0074] After providing a test protein disposed in bacteria, hydrogen exchange can then be initiated. To initiate hydrogen 
exchange, the bacteria are transferred to a deuterated media. Time-course studies indicate that under these conditions 
the D 2 O component of the deuterated media freely diffuses across the cell membrane, and the solvent deuterons 
exchange with labile protons of the protein within the cytoplasm of the cell. Chloramphenicol can be added to the 
deuterated media in order to inhibit further protein synthesis during the course of the exchange reaction, thereby pre-
venting deuteration during synthesis. After a given exchange period, the bacterial cells can then be lysed and the extent 
of exchange determined using MALDI mass spectrometry to measure the increase in mass, as shown in the general 
schematic diagram depicted in Figure 8. Additional preparation steps, and modification of those presented above will 
be apparent to one of skill in the art upon considering the protein under study in view of the present disclosure. 

V.B. Example of the In Vivo Methods of the Present Invention 

[0075] λ 6-85 is the monomeric form of the N-terminal domain of λ repressor (Huang &amp; Oas, (1995) Biochem. 34: 
3884-92). In part, because the stability of the N-terminal domain, measured in vitro, qualitatively correlates with its 
degradation rate and hence the activity of the full-length protein in vivo (Reidhaar-Olson et al., (1990) Biochem. 29: 
7563-71), variants of this protein having different stabilities were selected to illustrate the in vivo methods of the present 


EP 1 307 736 B1

invention. It has been proposed that this correlation in λ 6-85 exists because the folding kinetics of the protein, which 
occur on the millisecond time range in vitro (Burton et al., (1996) J. Mol. Biol. 263: 311-22), are in rapid pre-equilibrium 
relative to its proteolysis. This hypothesis is premised on the assumption that folding thermodynamics and kinetics 
observed in a simple buffer and dilute conditions are the same in intracellular environments. The present invention can 
be employed to test this assumption for any protein by employing hydrogen exchange to measure its stability in viable 
E. coli cells and compare the results to stability measurements in vitro in a typical buffer. 

V.C. Analysis of Data Acquired by the in vivo Methods of the Present Invention 

[0076] When partially folded intermediates are not present in vivo, MALDI MS-HX stability curves, such as those 
depicted in Figure 10C, can be used to estimate protein stability using the following equation (Ghaemmaghami et al., 
(2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 97: 8296-301): 

where (Pace, (1986) Method Enzymol. 131: 266-80): 

∆G f is the free energy of folding, [Denat.] is the denaturant concentration, m is δ∆G f / δ [Denat.], &lt;k int &gt; is the average 

exchange rate of unprotected amide hydrogens and is a function of pH and temperature (Ghaemmaghami et al., (2000) 
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 97: 8296-301). Equation (6) can be used to fit the MALDI MS-HX data for both in vivo and 
in vitro experiments, as demonstrated in Figure 10C and described herein. In Figure 10C, data for λ* 6-85 at 15 °C is 
presented for: (•) cell lysates at pH 8; (♦) cytoplasm of viable E. coli cells grown in normal LB media; and (P) MALDI 
MS-HX of viable E. coli cells equilibrated in hyperosmotic (1.2 M NaCl) LB media. The curves yield stabilities of 6.7+-
0.13 and 6.7+-0.2 kcal/mol in lysates and cells, respectively. The difference in the midpoints of the MALDI-MS-HX and 
CD curves results from the ability of MALDI MS-HX to detect small populations of denatured protein and is not indicative 
of a large stability change. The measured in vivo stability is 6.7 0.13 kcal/mol and the in vitro stability of the protein 
obtained by performing H/D exchange on lysed bacteria at pH 8 is 6.7 0.2 kcal/mol. 
[0077] Figure 10A shows a plot of the fraction denatured as determined by circular dichroism (CD) of a 10 PM solution 
of the pure protein in a 50 mM sodium acetate, 50 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, pH 8 buffer. The curve 
represents the best fit of the data using the linear extrapolation method (Pace, (1986) Method Enzymol. 131: 266-80), 
yielding a stability of 6.16+-0.13 kcal/mol. Similar plots can be generated for any protein of interest. Continuing with the 
example of λ 6-85 , conventional two-state analysis of the CD denaturation curve (Pace, (1986) Method Enzymol. 131: 
266-80) yields a stability estimate for λ 6-85 of 6.16 0.13 kcal/mol. 
[0078] If folding equilibrium constants measured in vitro are applicable in vivo, then it is reasonable to conclude that 
the kinetics of λ 6-85 are also comparable in and out of the cell. If this were not the case, then the rate constants for folding 
and unfolding would have to increase or decrease in vivo by the same factor, in order to maintain a constant equilibrium 
constant (i.e. stability), an event that seems unlikely. Thus, it is likely that the cellular lifetime of the native state of the 
N-terminal domain of λ repressor is approximately 30 milliseconds (Huang &amp; Oas, (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 
92: 6878-82). If this is indeed the case, then this protein, when not bound to DNA, samples the denatured state thousands 
of times during its lifetime in the cell. In a growing number of proteins, the unfolding rate appears to be faster than the 
folding rate and thus the proteins are predominately unfolded in vitro (Wright &amp; Dyson, (1999) J. Mol. Biol. 293: 321-31). 
The SUPREX method of the present invention can be particularly useful for determining whether these "intrinsically 
unstructured" proteins are as unstable in vivo as they appear to be in vitro. 
[0079] Figure 9 shows a plot of the increase in mass versus the length of the time the E. coli cells were exposed to 
deuterated media (i.e. the exchange time). In Figure 9, the mass of λ 6-85 versus H/D exchange time in vivo at is presented 
for three temperatures, 15°C (open diamonds), room temperature (closed circles), and 37°C (open squares). The ex-
change was conducted in LB media at pH 7. The mass at time=0 was determined by measuring the mass in an all-
protonated media. The dashed line shows the effective mass of the fully exchanged protein. The left y-axis shows the 
measured mass and the right y-axis shows the calculated fraction exchanged. Similar plots can be prepared for any 
system expressing a protein of interest. In this illustrative example of the present invention, the exchange was conducted 
at three different temperatures. As the exchange time increases, more deuterons replace the protons within the protein 
and the mass increases. This exchange reaction occurs faster at higher temperature.

[0080] The rates of H/D exchange are strongly pH dependent (Englander et al., (1996) Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 6: 
18-23). Above about pH 4 the exchange rates of amide hydrogens increase ten fold for every pH unit. It has been shown 
that E. coli maintains an intracellular pH of about 8 when the extracellular pH is between 6 and 9 (Padan et al., (1976) 
Eur. J. Biochem. 63: 533-41). The effect of extracellular pH on the extent of exchange after 20 minutes at room temperature 
is listed in Table 3. For the G46A/G48A thermostable variant of monomeric lambda repressor (λ 6-85 ), changing the 
extracellular pH from 7 to 8 did not change the rate of hydrogen exchange within the cell. In contrast, exchange experiments 
conducted with cells lysed with a non-ionic detergent showed significantly accelerated exchange at pH 8 compared to 
pH 7. Importantly, the exchange rate in cell lysate at pH 8 was equivalent to exchange in vivo consistent with an estimate 
of an intracellular pH of 8. Thus, in practicing the present invention, those of skill in the art will recognize that pH effects 
should be taken into account when designing experiments. 
[0081] The in vivo methods of the present invention can be employed to detect stability perturbations within a cell. 
Table 3 presents the effect perturbations caused by amino acid substitution and changes in the external environment 
on the extent of in vivo exchange of λ* 6-85 , which serves as an illustration of the present methods. The Q33Y substitution 
has been shown to increase the in vitro stability of the protein by 1.7 kcal/mol (Ghaemmaghami, et al., (2000) Proc. Natl. 
Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 97: 8296-301). As shown in Table 3, after 20 minutes, the λ 6-85 (Q33Y) variant exchanges less than 
the λ 6-85 variant suggesting that the stabilizing effect of this substitution is present in vivo. Record and co-workers have 
recently shown that the cytoplasm of E. coli grown in high-osmolarity medium contains less water and higher concen-
trations of naturally occurring osmolytes (Record et al., (1998) Trends Biochem. Sci. 23: 143-48; Record et al., (1998) 
Trends Biochem. Sci. 23: 190-94). It has been proposed that these physiological effects should increase intracellular 
protein stability by decreasing the water content, thereby favoring the less hydrated native state. Table 3 lists the extent 
of λ 6-85 exchange in E. coli cells that were equilibrated for 2 hours in a protonated medium containing 1.2 M NaCl prior 
to exchange in deuterated media that also contained 1.2 M NaCl. The reduced extent of exchange compared to the 
normal LB media, which contained 0.12 M NaCl, is consistent with the predicted in vivo stabilization. Also shown in 
Table 3 is the effect of adding 3 M urea to the exchange buffer, which increases the extent of exchange, suggesting that 
urea is destabilizing the protein. The increase in exchange caused by urea is evident even after 5 minutes indicating 
that the urea is rapidly diffusing inside the cell and destabilizing the protein. Thus, one advantage of the present invention 
over prior art systems is its ability to detect stability perturbations within a cell, an ability heretofore thought unattainable. 
[0082] Because the cell membrane is permeable to urea, it is possible to conduct MALDI MS-HX denaturation exper-
iments in vivo. Continuing with the present example, in vivo MALDI MS-HX experiments can be performed with cells 
expressing λ 6-85 at 15°C using a 20 minute exchange time (Figure 10C, diamonds). These experiments were carried 
out at an external pH of 7. As more urea is added, the extent of exchange increases as a result of global destabilization. 
This unfolding is not evident when the cells are grown in a hyperosmotic external environment (Figure 10C, triangles), 
consistent with the observations discussed above. Figure 9C also depicts a conventional in vitro SUPREX experiment 
in which the cells were lysed with a non-ionic detergent before exchange was initiated at pH 8 (Figure 10C, circles), 
which is indistinguishable from the in vivo denaturation curve in normal LB media. These observations indicate that the 
stability of λ 6-85 is the same in intact cells and cell lysates. This set of experiments further demonstrate the ability of the 
present invention to facilitate in vivo measurements of protein stability. 
[0083] It should be noted that although E. coli might not grow efficiently in 3M urea, exposure to 3M urea for up to 20 
minutes does not perturb the viability of the cells. Figure 10B shows the number of E. coli colony forming units in the 
culture after exposure to urea for 30 minutes relative to no exposure to denaturants. The number of colonies observed 
does not decrease until above 3M urea, at which point cell viability drops to almost nothing, presumably because crucial 
proteins are irreversibly denatured. Under the conditions of the denaturation experiments disclosed herein, where urea 
concentration did not exceed 3 M, the cells remain intact and viable. In Figure 10B, E. coli placed in various concentrations 
of urea for 30 minutes were studied at 23°C (closed circles) and 15°C (open circles). 
[0084] Recent genomic sequencing efforts have provided the DNA sequences of thousands of previously unknown 
genes (Moore et al., (1997) J. Mol. Biol. 272: 336-47). Assigning function to all these unknown sequences is envisioned 
as one of the major scientific tasks of the coming decades. Whether this process involves biochemical analysis or 
structure determination, the magnitude of the task is so great that it will be important to intelligently select out the most 
promising candidates for study. Many cellular proteins are not stable under typical in vitro conditions. Since both structural 
and functional analyses require stability, the MALDI MS-HX and SUPREX methods of the present invention can act as 
a fast screen for selecting promising stable proteins for further study. Similarly, large-scale screening of cloned and 
expressed polymorphic genes could efficiently aid in the identification of alleles that code for unstable proteins that cause 
a diseased phenotype. 
[0085] The methods disclosed in the present invention offer the first direct analysis of protein folding thermodynamics 
in vivo. This approach is useful in applications where the measurement of the in vivo stability of the protein provides 
important biological insights. Such studies can include, among others, studies of chaperone function, amyloid formation 
and heat and osmotic shock response of cells. 
[0086] The in vivo methods of the present invention, thus, can yield stability data that mirrors the disposition of a test

protein as it exists inside a cell. This ability to generate accurate measurements of in vivo protein stability using a mass 
spectrometry-based technique has been heretofore unavailable to researchers. It will be appreciated that all of the 
applications of the MALDI MS-HX and SUPREX methods of the present invention can be performed in vivo using the 
steps disclosed herein. In practice, this ability makes protein stability data more indicative of the stability of a protein, as 
it exists inside a cell. This enhanced insight into protein stability can translate into more reliable and accurate screening 
methods, diagnostic procedures, protein folding research and any other application where protein stability plays a role. 

VI. Application of the Derived Relationships 

[0087] In the following sections, the wide range of applicability of the above derived relationships is illustrated by 
several specific examples. These examples are presented for illustrative purposes only and those of skill in the art will, 
upon consideration of the present disclosure, undoubtedly appreciate other applications of the mathematical relationships 
and the methods applying those relationships that form the various aspect of the present invention. 

VII Method of Quantitatively Determining the Stability of a Test Protein 

[0088] In a preferred embodiment, the MALDI MS-HX methods of the present invention can be applied to the study 
of protein stability. In this embodiment of the present invention, the following general procedure can be employed. 
Modifications of the following procedure will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon consideration of the present 
disclosure. 

VII.A. Hydropen-Deuterium Exchange in Protein Stability Studies 

[0089] In one aspect of the present invention, hydrogen exchange as detected by MALDI mass spectrometry is em-
ployed to analyze the global stability of the protein. As deuterons replace protons in the protein the protein gains mass. 
The increase in mass can be followed as a function of time with a MALDI mass spectrometer, as disclosed in the present 
invention. The addition of denaturants globally destabilizes the protein and increases the observed exchange rate by 
increasing the rate of the global exchange mechanism. By conducting exchange for a given amount of time as a function 
of denaturant concentration, a denaturation curve can be obtained (Ghaemmaghami et al., (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 
U.S.A. 97: 8296-301). 
[0090] The following non-limiting embodiment of the present invention is presented purely for illustrative purposes; 
those of skill in the art will recognize that the example discloses a general methodology and can be applied mutatis 
mutandis to any protein of interest. Figures 6A-6D depicts unfolding curves for B1 domain where exchange was allowed 
to occur for three different time intervals in the absence and presence of Fc fragment. The MALDI-HX stability curves 
of Figures 6A-6D are for B1 domain at 22 °C, pH 6 in the absence (closed circles) and presence (open circles) of 24 
PM Fc fragment. Figure 6A is WT*, 10 minutes of exchange, Figure 6B is WT*, 90 minutes of exchange, Figure 6C is 
WT* 180 minutes of exchange and Figure 6D is E27A mutant, 90 minutes of exchange. The measured stabilities are 
listed in Table 2. The sigmoidal transition in the plots result from the increase in exchange rate incurred by GdmCl 
induced destabilization. As the protein is destabilized, a larger increase in mass occurs in the given exchange time. In 
the presence of 3M GdmCl, all exchangeable protons in B1 domain are replaced by deuterons after ten minutes of 
exchange. Table 2 lists the measured mass of the protein after complete exchange. The calculated fraction exchanged 
(FE) values are also plotted in Figures 6A-6D. The initial baseline of the curve corresponds to the fast-exchanging local 
NHs that exchange with solvent rapidly in a denaturant independent manner (Ghaemmaghami et al., (2000) Proc. Natl. 
Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 97: 8296-301). When the present invention is employed to study a given protein or set of proteins, the 
disclosed, or a similar method, of presenting exchange data can be adopted. 

VII.B. General Sample Preparation Protocol 

[0091] The general protocol for the preparation of samples can comprise the following general protocol. A protein of 
interest (i.e. a test protein) can be cloned into a suitable expression vector, such as a T7 expression vector and the 
protein expressed in a convenient cell line, for example BL21-(DE3) E. coli cells. Cells can conveniently be grown on 
96 well plates or other support. 
[0092] The MALDI MS-HX and SUPREX methods disclosed in the present invention are applicable to expression cell 
types other than bacteria, thus allowing studies to be performed under nearly in vivo conditions. Standard techniques, 
such as those described above, can be used with variety of host-expression vector systems can be utilized. These 
include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g., E. coli, B. subtilis) transformed with recombinant 
bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing desired coding sequences; yeast (e.g., 
Saccharomyces, Pichia) transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing desired coding sequences; 


EP 1 307 736 B1 

18 

5 





















insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus) containing desired coding 
sequences; plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV; 
tobacco mosaic virus, TMV) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid) containing 
desired coding sequences; or mammalian cell systems (e.g., COS, CHO, BHK, 293, 3T3) harboring recombinant ex-
pression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g., metallothionein promoter) 
or from mammalian viruses (e.g., the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter; lentiviral vectors). 
[0093] In bacterial systems a number of expression vectors can be advantageously selected. For example, when large 
quantities of protein are to be produced, vectors which direct the expression of high levels of protein products that are 
readily purified can be desirable. Such vectors can include but are not limited to the E. coli expression vector pUR278 
(Ruther et al., (1983) EMBO J 2: 1791), in which a coding sequence can be ligated individually into the vector in frame 
with the lac Z coding region so that a protein containing a portion of the lac Z product is provided; pIN vectors (Inouye 
et al., (1985) Nucleic Acids Res. 13: 3101-09; Van Heeke et al., (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264: 5503-9); and the like. A T7 
vector is a preferred vector. pGEX vectors can also be used to express foreign polypeptides, such as a protein containing 
glutathione S-transferase (GST). In general, such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells 
by adsorption to glutathione agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. 
[0094] Expression of the test protein can be induced by the addition of IPTG or other compound. Cells can then be 
pelleted and lysed using a lysis solution, such as a BUGBUSTER™ solution, available from Novagen, Madison, Wis-
consin. Lysates can then be centrifuged and the test protein isolated using protein purification methods known to those 
of skill in the art. Alternatively, as described further herein below, the SUPREX methods do not require a purification 
step. Hydrogen exchange can then be initiated. 
[0095] Hydrogen exchange can be initiated by adding 10-fold excess or other desired amount of deuterated exchange 
buffer to the lysed cultures or the purified test protein. A series of exchange buffers can be made up comprising different 
concentrations of a denaturant, such as guanidinium chloride (GdmCl). The lysed cultures or purified protein is then 
allowed to exchange for a desired period of time (e.g. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 70, 80, or 120 minutes), 
the exchange time t. 
[0096] When particularly high sensitivity is desired, protein samples can be subjected to a micro-concentration step 
after H/D exchange and prior to MALDI analysis. Such a micro-concentration step can involve a batch chromatography 
method utilizing small reverse phase chromatography columns, such as 10 PL C 18 SUPROTIPS™ available from AmiKa 
(Columbia, Maryland). Preferably, the H/D exchange reaction is quenched with TFA (0.25 % v/v) prior to binding deu-
terated protein samples to the columns. This quenching helps to preserve the deuteration state of the protein. Binding 
of a test protein to the column can be achieved by repeatedly pipetting a 2 PL aliquot into the column, waiting five 
seconds, and expelling the aliquot to waste. The column can then be rinsed with a 2 PL aliquot of an ice-cold, aqueous 
solution comprising 5% MeOH and 0.1 %TFA in order to wash away excess denaturant. Finally, the test protein can be 
eluted from the column and directly onto a MALDI sample stage using approximately 1 Pl of the ice-cold MALDI matrix 
solution. 
[0097] When the exchange period has elapsed, an aliquot of the exchange reaction is added to a volume of a solution 
comprising a MALDI matrix compound (the matrix solution). A preferred matrix compound in the present invention is 
sinapinic acid. Although the composition of a matrix solution can vary with the matrix compound itself, a matrix solution 
for sinapinic acid can comprise a saturated solution of sinapinic acid in 45% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (pH 
3.0), which is preferably kept on ice (2 °C) prior to the addition of the protein. The addition of the deuterated sample to 
the matrix solution unfolds the protein and causes a fixed number of deuterons to re-exchange with protons. Experimental 
data indicate that the remaining deuterons are relatively stable and re-exchange at a slower rate of 0.001 s -1 (Figure 1 
A). Once the matrix forms a solid crystal, the exchange rate slows to a rate of 0.001 min -1 (Figure 1 B). By rapidly drying 
the sample on a MALDI target, the slowly exchanging deuterons are trapped in the time frame of the experiment and 
their number can be determined from a mass spectrum (Figure 2A). 
[0098] A reference protein can also be added to the matrix solution, when highly accurate mass measurements are 
desired. Suitable reference proteins can be bovine serum albumin (BSA), lysozyme or a biosynthetic nonnatural polypep-
tide. The mass of the test protein can then determined employing the reference protein as an internal standard. 
[0099] Following incubation of the test protein with the matrix, an aliquot of the solution is then placed on a MALDI 
target and rapidly dried under an air stream. Preferably, aliquots are placed in the matrix and dried within 1 minute. For 
a given data point, multiple MALDI spectra can be analyzed and the results averaged. Protein concentrations in each 
spot can range between 0.1 and 1 pmol of protein, however as mass spectrometry technology improves, smaller con-
centrations, such as attomole amounts of sample can be analyzed. Thus, there is effectively no limit on the amount of 
protein analyzed using the methods of the present invention. MALDI MS spectra of the sample can then be acquired, 
providing information regarding the mass of a test protein. Mass spectra can be collected on any mass spectrometer, 
(the VOYAGER® Biospectrometry Workstation, available from PerSeptive Biosystems Inc. of Framingham, Massachu-
setts is a preferred mass spectrometer). Spectra can be acquired in positive ion mode and summed over 32 (or other 
desired number) laser shots.

[0100] The observed mass of a test protein can then be corrlelated with its stability. A correlation can be achieved by 
fitting the observed data to equation (6) to obtain a value of ∆G f , which represents the stability of the test protein. As 
described further below, denaturation curves can offer additional insight into the stability of a test protein. 
[0101] For illustrative purposes, the B1 domain of streptococcal protein G (B1 domain) has been adopted as a test 
protein, which was prepared according to the above general protocol. Specific details of the preparation of this and other 
samples can be found throughout the present disclosure and the Laboratory Examples. The following discussion, then, 
makes reference to this protein, although any protein can serve as a test protein. 

VII.C. Acquisition of a Stability Value 

[0102] Data generated using the MALDI MS-HX methods can be fit to an appropriate equation, for example Equation 
(6), to determine the stability of a test protein under native conditions. A summary of results generated by employing 
this methodology is presented in Table 1. This analysis broadly involves the extrapolation of the linear free energy versus 
denaturant concentration curves to 0 M. 

VIII. Method of Detecting a Binding Event Involving a Test Protein and a Test Ligand 

[0103] It has long been known that the binding of a substrate to the native conformation of a protein increases its 
thermodynamic stability (Warren et al., (1964) Biochem. J. 93: 409-19; Citri, (1973) Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. 
Biol. 37: 397-648; Goldberg &amp; Dice, (1974) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 43: 835-69; Pace &amp; McGrath, (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 
255: 3862-65; Pace &amp; Grimsley, (1988) Biochem. 27: 3242-46). The relationship between stability changes and disso-
ciation constants have been quantitatively established (Schellman, (1975) Biopolymers 14: 999-1018). Experimental 
and data analysis designs based on this known relationship form an aspect of the present invention. 
[0104] Measuring binding by exploiting the relationship between stability and dissociation constants offers advantages 
over conventional titration methods such as Scatchard analysis (Segel, (1975) Enzyme Kinetics, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 
New York, New York). For example, the concentrations of a test protein (such as an enzyme) can be much higher than 
the applicable dissociation constant (s) (Xie et al., (2000) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 122: 11533-34). This flexibility in concentration 
permits very tight dissociation constants to be measured without the need to resort to other detection methods. 
[0105] Additionally, it is possible to partition the changes in observable binding energy into energetic effects on the 
free and bound form of the protein. For example, if a mutation is found to increase the dissociation constant, it can be 
determined whether this was due to a decrease in the stability of the protein or to a decrease in the interaction energy. 
This ability adds another facet that can be considered when analyzing binding analysis data. 
[0106] Furthermore, the link between stability and dissociation constants is a general relationship and can be applied 
to all proteins, regardless of size, function or amino acid composition. Moreover, there is no need for supplemental, 
potentially time-consuming manipulations, such as labeling reactions. This general strategy has been employed to 
measure the dissociation constants of a number of small ligands to proteins (Pace &amp; McGrath, (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 
255: 3862-65; Pace &amp; Grimsley, (1988) Biochem. 27: 3242-46; Schwartz, (1988) Biochem. 27: 8429-36; Brandts &amp; Lin, 
(1990) Biochem. 29: 6927-40; Straume &amp; Freire, (1992) Anal. Biochem. 203: 259-68; Graziano et al., (1996) Biochem. 
35: 13386-92; Kanaya et al., (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271: 32729-36; Xie et al., (2000) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 122: 11533-34). 
[0107] The aforementioned studies employed differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) or temperature and chemical 
denaturations as detected by circular dichroism (CD) or other spectroscopic probes to detect binding-induced stability 
changes. These detection techniques impose significant practical limitations on the linked stability-binding approach. 
They are inherently low throughput techniques that require fairly large quantities of pure protein. Furthermore, the 
presence of significant concentrations of other proteins cannot be tolerated as they can obscure the signal of the protein 
of interest. Thus, these techniques cannot be applied to unpurified samples. This makes it difficult to analyze protein-
protein interactions because the substrate protein must be present in equivalent or excess concentrations relative to the 
protein whose signal is being detected. 
[0108] The MALDI MS-HX methods of the present invention (including SUPREX) can detect substrate induced stability 
increases using hydrogen exchange as detected by MALDI mass spectrometry. The MALDI MS-HX methods of the 
present invention can tolerate the excess presence of other proteins and can be used to measure protein-protein inter-
actions in crude extracts. In one aspect of the present invention, SUPREX can be employed to analyze the binding of 
one protein with another in an unpurified cell lysate. To illustrate this point and demonstrate the uncomplicated application 
power and sensitivity of the methods of the present invention, the binding of the B1 domain of staphylococcal protein G 
(B1) to the Fc fragment of goat IgG (Fc) was studied. 
[0109] It will be appreciated that the following is an illustrative example and the methods disclosed herein can be 
applied to any protein; indeed, this is an advantage of the methods of the present invention.

VIII.A. Mathematical Relationships Linking Fraction Exchanged (FE), Substrate Concentration and the Dissociation 
Constant for a Test Protein and a Test Ligand 

[0110] The mathematical relationships useful for determining a fraction of hydrogens exchanged with deuterons can 
be derived similarly to-those relationships previously derived linking stability and change in mass. A derivation can start 
with the classical hydrogen exchange model (Hvidt &amp; Nielson, (1966) Adv. Protein Chem. 21: 287-386): 

where k ex is the observed exchange rate for each hydrogen, k open and k close are the rate constants for the conformational 
changes leading to exchange competent and exchange incompetent states, respectively, and k int is the exchange rate 
for the unprotected hydrogen. Under EX2 conditions where K close (or k open ) are much greater than k int : 

where K open is the equilibrium constant between the exchange competent and exchange incompetent conformations of 
the protein (k open /k close ). For the hydrogens that are exchanging through a global unfolding mechanism, 

Where K unfold is the global unfolding equilibrium constant. Substituting (10) into (2): 

Since k int is similar among the majority of the backbone amide hydrogens (Bai et al., (1994) Proteins 20: 4-14), the total 
exchange of the hydrogens that exchange through global unfolding can be estimated by a single rate constant. The 
increase in mass due to the exchange of globally exchanging protons as a function of time can thus be estimated by 
the following first order rate equation: 

M deut is the mass of the fully deuterated protein, A is the amplitude of the mass increase, t is the exchange time. The 
change in mass can be normalized to obtain fraction exchanged (FE): 

Where M prot is the mass of the fully protonated protein. Equation (13) can be transformed to: 

where A FE is the fraction of the protein that remains unexchanged. Substitution of Equation (11) into Equation (14) gives 
an equation for FE vs. denaturant concentration: 


EP 1 307 736 B1

where (Pace, (1986) Method Enzymol. 131: 266-80): 

∆G 0 unfold is the free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant, R is the gas constant and T is the temperature 

expressed in degrees Kelvin. Global stabilities can then be determined by fitting FE vs. [denaturant] plots to Equation 
(15). The m value in Equation (15) determines the sharpness of the transition in the FE vs. [denaturant] plot. Myers et 
al. have shown that m values can be estimated from the size of the protein (Myers et al., (1995) Protein Sci. 4: 2138-48). 
According to their analysis, B1 domain is predicted to have an m value of 1.6 0.4 kcal mol -1 M -1 . In Equation (15), 
&lt;k int &gt; is the average exchange rate of unprotected amide hydrogens and is a function of pH and temperature. &lt;k int &gt; 
were estimated to be 30 min -1 based on the measurements of Englander et al. (Bai et al., (1994) Proteins 20: 4-14). 
The above k int and m values were kept constant in the least square fitting of the data to Equation (15). 
[0111] The stability of a protein in the event of single site substrate binding is described (Schellman, (1975) Biopolymers 
14: 999-1018; Pace &amp; McGrath, (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255: 3862-65) by: 

where ∆G 0 
unfold(bound) and ∆G 0 
unfold(unbound) are the folding free energies in the absence and presence of substrate, 
S free is the concentration of unbound substrate in the solution and K d is the dissociation constant for binding. Experiments 
can be designed such that the concentration of a test ligand (Fc fragment) is not in great excess of the test protein. 
Therefore, depletion of substrate can be taken into consideration (Segel, (1975) Enzyme Kinetics, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 
New York, New York): 

where S total and E total are the total concentrations of the test ligand (Fc fragment) and test protein (B1 domain), respec-
tively. The above equations provide a relationship between FE, substrate concentration and the dissociation constant. 
These relationships can be employed in the quantitative study of an interaction between a test protein and a test ligand. 
These relationships were used to fit the binding curve in Figure 5. Thus, the disclosed relationships can be used to fit 
data generated in accordance with the methods of the present invention. 

VIII.A. 1. Considerations in the Derivation of the Mathematical Relationships 

[0112] In order to derive Equation (15), several approximations have been made. In the context of the illustrative 
example of B1 and Fc interaction it would be expected that for the unbound B1 domain, the ∆G 0 
unfold obtained at different 
exchange times would be the same. However, Table 2 indicates that the stabilities measured with 10, 90 and 180 minutes 
of exchange are 5.1, 5.6 and 5.8 kcal/mol respectively. This deviation might stem from error in the estimation that the 
global exchange rates among different hydrogens are the same. In reality, the global exchange rates vary according to 
their k int values. Therefore, the overall global exchange kinetics of the protein is multi-exponential. Equation (14) attempts 
to fit the multi-exponential exchange with a single exponential equation. The general error introduced is that at higher 
exchange times, the FE is over-estimated and at lower exchange times it is under-estimated. As a result, the stabilities 
measured by MALDI MS-HX curves at longer exchange times are generally greater than those measured at shorter 
exchange times. But, the closer the global exchange rates of the amide hydrogens (of the protein backbone) are together, 
the less this discrepancy is evident. The variation within global exchange rates is typically within one order of magnitude 
and the stabilities measured at varying exchange times should be within ∼ 1 kcal/mol. 
[0113] The stability of B1 domain, as measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at this temperature, is 
6.10.5 kcal/mol. This value is slightly higher than the stabilities measured by the MALDI MS-HX methods of the present 
invention. There are a number of factors that can introduce discrepancies between stabilities measured by hydrogen 
exchange and other denaturation techniques. The most important of these is the accuracy of k int values. Here, for the 
B1 domain, the average of the k int values determined from the measurements of Bai et al. for model peptides (Bai et 
al., (1993) Proteins 17: 75-86) was used. 


EP 1 307 736 B1 

22 

5 





















[0114] However, the potential inaccuracies introduced into ∆G 0 unfold measurements by hydrogen exchange do not 
affect the measured differences between ∆G 0 
unfold of bound and unbound protein (∆∆G 0 
unfold ). The errors in the ∆G 0 

unfold 

of the protein cancel each other out and differences in energy can be measured more accurately than absolute ∆G 0 

unfold 

(Li &amp; Woodward, (1999) Protein Sci. 8: 1571-90). ∆∆G 0 unfold can be converted to dissociation constants as described 
in the Laboratory Examples. According to the data in Table 2, the dissociation constant of B1 domain is in the range of 
100 nM to 1.1 PM, which corresponds to the published dissociation constant of B1 domain (300 nM). Thus, the methods 
of the present invention can reliably reproduce known results, thereby validating their effectiveness. 

VIII.A. 2. MALDI MS-HX Stability Curves Are Different From Regular Denaturation Curves 

[0115] It should be noted that the stability curves obtained from MALDI MS-HX analysis (such as those depicted in 
Figures 3B and 4) are not identical to conventional denaturation curves, such as those generated by circular dichroism 
(CD) or other methods. The midpoint of transition in conventional denaturation curves are a function of the stability and 
the m value of the protein. In the MALDI MS-HX curves, the midpoint is not only a function of these parameters but also 
depends on the time of exchange (t) and &lt;k int &gt;. 

where C 1/2 
MS-HX and C 1/2 
den are the midpoints of transition in the MALDI MS-HX analysis and conventional denaturation 
curves respectively and &lt;k int &gt; is itself a function of pH and temperature (Bai et al., (1993) Proteins 17: 75-86). As Equation 
(8) demonstrates, a MALDI MS-HX curve can be shifted to the left relative to a conventional denaturation curve, since 
&lt;k int &gt;t is always much greater than 0.693 (the numerical value of ln2). 
[0116] Referring again to the illustrative examples of MBP and λ 6-85 presented in the present invention, under the 
conditions used for the experiments described herein, this effect shifts the MALDI MS-HX curves of MBP and λ 6-85 by 
0.5 and 2.4 M, respectively. Those of skill in the art will, therefore, recognize that the value of C 1/2 
MS-HX can be purposely 
altered by changing the pH, temperature, or exchange interval ("t"). High stabilities can be measured at higher pH and/or 
temperature, low stabilities at lower pH and/or temperature. Additionally, the exchange interval can conveniently range 
from a few minutes to hours. For example, according to Equation (8), the midpoint of the MALDI MS-HX curve for λ 6-85 
can be shifted to the right by 1 M relative to the curves shown in Figures 4A-4H by changing the pH to 5.9 and the 
exchange time to 11 minutes. This sort of adjustment makes the MALDI MS-HX methods of the present invention flexible 
for acquiring measurements over a wide range of stabilities. 

VIII.B. Method of Qualitatively Detecting a Binding Event Involving a Test Protein and a Test Ligand 

[0117] The methods of the present invention facilitate a quantitative determination of binding constants and other data 
arising from a binding event involving a test protein and a test ligand. However, in another aspect of the present invention, 
a qualitative determination of the occurrence of a binding event can also be made. This ability can be helpful in a variety 
of situations in which a quantitative measurement is not required. For example, in the context of a high-throughput 
screening application, it might be desirable to simply know whether a given test ligand associates with a given test 
protein. Such a need can be met by the present invention. This qualitative aspect of the present invention is described 
more fully in the following section. 

VIII.B. 1. Experimental Procedure for Qualitatively Detecting a Binding Event Involving a Test Protein and a Test Ligand 

[0118] This application of the MALDI MS-HX method takes advantage of the fact that a binding event can have the 
effect of altering the stability of a protein. For example, a protein might interact with a ligand, and that interaction might 
stabilize or destabilize the protein's structure to a degree different than the stability of the protein in the absence of the 
ligand. The effect of ligand binding on the stability of the protein can be graphically represented via denaturation curves. 
Initially, a denaturation curve is acquired for the test protein in the absence of ligand. This curve can be generated or 
referred to, if it is generally available. The denaturation curve for the test protein in the absence of ligand can serve as 
a reference or standard curve against which an effect of a ligand binding event can be gauged. 
[0119] A binding event can be qualitatively detected by employing the following generally presented method. The 
following steps are directed to the preparation of a denaturation curve for a test protein in the presence of ligand. A 
denaturation curve for the test protein in the absence of ligand can be generated prior to or subsequent to the generation 
of a denaturation curve of the test protein obtained in the absence of a test ligand. For data analysis denaturation curves 
corresponding to the test protein in the presence and absence of a test ligand should be available for comparision.

[0120] Initially, samples are prepared. Suitable preparation steps are disclosed herein and can comprise overexpress-
ing a protein of interest in bacterial cells and lysing the cells. Steps for overexpressing a protein of interest in bacterial 
or other cell type and lysing of the cell are well known and described in the literature (e.g., Sambrook et al., (1992) 
Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, New York). If desired, the sample can be disposed on a 
support such as a plastic 96 well microtiter plate. 
[0121] Expression of the test protein can be induced by the addition of IPTG or other compound. Cells can then be 
pelleted and lysed using a lysis solution, such as a BUGBUSTER™ solution, available from Novagen, Madison, Wis-
consin. Lysates can then be centrifuged and the test protein isolated using protein purification methods known to those 
of skill in the art. Alternatively, as described further herein below, the SUPREX methods do not require a purification 
step. Hydrogen exchange can then be initiated. 
[0122] Hydrogen exchange can be initiated by adding 10-fold excess or other desired amount of deuterated exchange 
buffer to the lysed cultures or the purified test protein. A series of exchange buffers can be made up comprising different 
concentrations of a denaturant, such as guanidinium chloride (GdmCl). The lysed cultures or purified protein is then 
allowed to exchange for a desired period of time (e.g. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 70, 80, or 120 minutes), 
the exchange time t. 
[0123] When particularly high sensitivity is desired, protein samples can be subjected to a micro-concentration step 
after H/D exchange and prior to MALDI analysis. Such a micro-concentration step can involve a batch chromatography 
method utilizing small reverse phase chromatography columns, such as 10 PL C 18 SUPROTIPS™ available from AmiKa 
(Columbia, Maryland). Preferably, the H/D exchange reaction is quenched with TFA (0.25 % v/v) prior to binding deu-
terated protein samples to the columns. This quenching helps to preserve the deuteration state of the protein. Binding 
of a test protein to the column can be achieved by repeatedly pipetting a 2 PL aliquot into the column, waiting five 
seconds, and expelling the aliquot to waste. The column can then be rinsed with a 2 PL aliquot of an ice-cold, aqueous 
solution comprising 5% MeOH and 0.1%TFA in order to wash away excess denaturant. Finally, the test protein can be 
eluted from the column and directly onto a MALDI sample stage using approximately 1 Pl of the ice-cold MALDI matrix 
solution. 
[0124] When the exchange period has elapsed, an aliquot of the exchange reaction is added to a volume of a solution 
comprising a MALDI matrix compound (the matrix solution). A preferred matrix compound in the present invention is 
sinapinic acid. Although the composition of a matrix solution can vary with the matrix compound itself, a matrix solution 
for sinapinic acid can comprise a saturated solution of sinapinic acid in 45% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (pH 
3.0), which is preferably kept on ice (2 °C) prior to the addition of the protein. The addition of the deuterated sample to 
the matrix solution unfolds the protein and causes a fixed number of deuterons to re-exchange with protons. Experimental 
data indicate that the remaining deuterons are relatively stable and re-exchange at a slower rate of 0.001 s -1 (Figure 1 
A). Once the matrix forms a solid crystal, the exchange rate slows to a rate of 0.001 min -1 (Figure 1 B). By rapidly drying 
the sample on a MALDI target, the slowly exchanging deuterons are trapped in the time frame of the experiment and 
their number can be determined from a mass spectrum (Figure 2A). 
[0125] A reference protein can also be added to the matrix solution, when highly accurate mass measurements are 
desired. Suitable reference proteins can be bovine serum albumin (BSA), lysozyme or a biosynthetic nonnatural polypep-
tide. The mass of the test protein can then determined employing the reference protein as an internal standard. 
[0126] Following incubation of the test protein with the matrix, an aliquot of the solution is then placed on a MALDI 
target and rapidly dried under an air stream. Preferably, aliquots are placed in the matrix and dried within 1 minute. For 
a given data point, multiple MALDI spectra can be analyzed and the results averaged. Protein concentrations in each 
spot can range between 0.1 and 1 pmol of protein, however as mass spectrometry technology improves, smaller con-
centrations, such as attomole amounts of sample can be analyzed. Thus, there is effectively no limit on the amount of 
protein analyzed using the methods of the present invention. MALDI MS spectra of the sample can then be acquired, 
providing information regarding the mass of a test protein. Mass spectra can be collected on any mass spectrometer, 
(the VOYAGER® Biospectrometry Workstation, available from PerSeptive Biosystems Inc. of Framingham, Massachu-
setts is a preferred mass spectrometer). Spectra can be acquired in positive ion mode and summed over 32 (or other 
desired number) laser shots. This general MALDI MS-HX protocol can be used to generate a data set comprising the 
mass of the test protein as a function of denaturant concentration. These data can be plotted to generate a denaturation 
curve, such as those presented in Figure 3A. If a denaturation curve for the test protein in the absence of a test ligand 
is not available, the same general method can be employed to generate such a curve. 
[0127] Next, the denaturation data can be analyzed. Analysis can comprise evaluating the change in mass of the test 
protein as a function of denaturant concentration. Preferably, both of the denaturation curves for a test protein (i.e. 
denaturation curves for the test protein in the presence and absence of a test ligand) are plotted on the same graph. 
The two curves are then compared qualitatively. If the curve corresponding to the test protein in the presence of the test 
ligand significantly overlaps the curve corresponding to the test protein in the absence of the test ligand, it can be 
concluded that there is no interaction between the test ligand and the test protein. 
[0128] The midpoints of the two denaturation curves can serve as convenient reference points for such a comparison. 


EP 1 307 736 B1

If the two curves do not significantly overlap, however, it can be concluded that there is an interaction occurring involving 
the test ligand and the test protein. Thus, a shift in the position of a denaturation curve in the presence of a test ligand 
can be used to qualitatively detect a binding event involving a test ligand and a test protein. 
[0129] As noted, the midpoints of the denaturation curves can themselves be analyzed. There are three broad cate-
gories of factors that determine the position of the midpoint of the MALDI MS-HX denaturation curves: First, thermody-
namic parameters (∆G 0 
unfold and m-value), second, factors that affect the k int term (the exchange rate of unprotected 
amide hydrogens), (pH, temperature, other solution conditions, and possible exchange-protection in the denatured state) 
and third, exchange time, t. When comparing the curves in the absence and presence of a test ligand (such as those 
presented in Figures 3B and 6A-6D, which are discussed in detail herein) all the factors remain constant except for 
∆G 0 unfold . 

[0130] An observed shift in the curves observed in the presence of substrate is due to an increase in global stability. 
In Figures 6B and 6C, for example, both curves shift to the right relative to Figure 6A, due to an increase in the exchange 
times. Figure 6D shows the curves for a variant of B1 domain that contains a E27A mutation in the binding site. The 
mutation had been previously shown to significantly increase the dissociation constant (Sloan &amp; Hellinga, (1999) Protein 
Sci. 8: 1643-48). The lack of stabilization upon addition of Fc fragment supports the previous observation. Assuming 
that the protein unfolds in a two-state fashion, the denaturation plots in Figures 6A-6D can be fitted to Equation (6) to 
obtain the global stability. For the Illustrative example, the measured global stabilities obtained from Figure 6A-6D are 
listed in Table 2. 

VIII.C. Method of Quantitatively Detecting a Binding Event Involving a Test Protein and a Test Ligand 

[0131] Protein G is a cell wall component of certain Staphylocococcal and Streptpcoccal bacteria and can bind to the 
Fc portion of mammalian IgG antibodies (Frick et al., (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89: 8532-36). The B1 domain 
used in this study is a natural variation of the IgG binding domain in Streptococcol protein G (Fahnestock et al., (1986) 
J. Bacteriol. 167: 870-80). The interaction of the B1 domain with the Fc domain of IgG has been characterized thermo-
dynamically and structurally and serves as an effective model for the study of protein-protein energetics (Derrick &amp; 
Wigley, (1992) Nature 359: 752-54; Derrick &amp; Wigley, (1994) J. Mol. Biol. 243: 906-18; Gallagher et al., (1994) Biochem. 
33: 4721-29; Orban et al., (1994) Biochem. 33: 5702-10; Sauer-Eriksson et al., (1995) Structure 3: 265-78; Walker et 
al., (1995) Biochem. J. 310: 177-84; Sloan &amp; Hellinga, (1998) Protein Eng. 11: 819-23; Sloan &amp; Hellinga, (1999) Protein 
Sci. 8: 1643-48). The dissociation constant for the association of the B1 domain with the Fc domain of IgG has been 
measured by DSC, intrinsic fluorescence and engineered fluorophores to be in the order of 300 nM (Gallagher et al., 
(1994) Biochem. 33: 4721-29; Walker et al., (1995) Biochem. J. 310: 177-84; Sloan &amp; Hellinga, (1998) Protein Eng. 11: 
819-23). In this illustrative example, B1 can be considered to be a test protein, while the Fc fragment of IgG can be 
considered to be a test ligand.

or other cell type and lysing of the cell are well known and described in the literature (e.g., Sambrook et al., (1992) 
Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, New York). Generally, a gene encoding a test protein can 
be cloned into a expression vector, such as a T7 expression vector, and expressed in cells, such as E. Coli strain 
BL21-(DE3) cells. Cultures can be conveniently grown on LB or other medium. If desired, the cultures can be disposed 
on a support such as a plastic 96 well microtiter plate. 
[0133] Expression of the test protein can be induced by the addition of IPTG or other compound. Cells can then be 
pelleted and lysed using a lysis solution, such as a BUGBUSTER™ solution, available from Novagen, Madison, Wis-

allowed to exchange for a desired period of time (e.g. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 70, 80, or 120 minutes), 
the exchange time t. 
[0135] When particularly high sensitivity is desired, protein samples can be subjected to a micro-concentration step 
after H/D exchange and prior to MALDI analysis. Such a micro-concentration step can involve a batch chromatography

3.0), which is preferably kept on ice (2 °C) prior to the addition of the protein. The addition of the deuterated sample to 
the matrix solution unfolds the protein and causes a fixed number of deuterons to re-exchange with protons. Experimental 
data indicate that the remaining deuterons are relatively stable and re-exchange at a slower rate of 0.001 s -1 (Figure 
1A). Once the matrix forms a solid crystal, the exchange rate slows to a rate of 0.001 min -1 (Figure 1 B). By rapidly 
drying the sample on a MALDI target, the slowly exchanging deuterons are trapped in the time frame of the experiment 
and their number can be determined from a mass spectrum (Figure 2A). 
[0137] A reference protein can also be added to the matrix solution, when highly accurate mass measurements are 
desired. Suitable reference proteins can be bovine serum albumin (BSA), lysozyme or a biosynthetic nonnatural polypep-
tide. The mass of the test protein can then determined employing the reference protein as an internal standard. 
[0138] Following incubation of the test protein with the matrix, an aliquot of the solution is then placed on a MALDI 
target and rapidly dried under an air stream. Preferably, aliquots are placed in the matrix and dried within 1 minute. For 
a given data point, multiple MALDI spectra can be analyzed and the results averaged. Protein concentrations in each 
spot can range between 0.1 and 1 pmol of protein, however as mass spectrometry technology improves, smaller con-
centrations, such as attomole amounts of sample can be analyzed. Thus, there is effectively no limit on the amount of 
protein analyzed using the methods of the present invention. MALDI MS spectra of the sample can then be acquired, 
providing information regarding the mass of a test protein. Mass spectra can be collected on any mass spectrometer, 
(the VOYAGER® Biospectrometry Workstation, available from PerSeptive Biosystems Inc. of Framingham, Massachu-
setts is a preferred mass spectrometer). Spectra can be acquired in positive ion mode and summed over 32 (or other 
desired number) laser shots. 

VIII.C. 2. Calculation of a Dissociation Constant for a Test Protein and a Test Ligand 

[0139] The representative dissociation constants presented in Table 2 were calculated by analyzing binding at a single 
substrate concentration. Thus, in another aspect of the present invention, affinities can similarly be measured by analyzing 
binding curves obtained by conducting exchange experiments as a function of substrate concentration in the presence 
of denaturant. Figure 5 shows the FE of B1 domain in the presence of 0.75 M denaturant (GdmCl). As ligand (which 
can comprise virtually any kind of molecule) is added, the extent of exchange decreases due to protein stabilization. 
The dissociation constant can be determined by least square analysis of the binding curve as described herein. The 
measured binding constant, 500 nM, is close to the expected value, offering further validation for results acquired by 
employing the present invention. 
[0140] If it is desired to screen a large number of protein variants or substrates for binding without determining the 
dissociation constants quantitatively, it is sufficient to measure the exchange under a single set of conditions. For example, 
in the present invention, the exchange of a number of B1 domain variants that had mutations in the Fc binding site in 
the presence of 0.75 M GdmCl was measured. The exchange experiments were conducted in the absence and presence 
of 100 Pm Fc fragment. Figure 7A shows the comparison of the FE of the B1 domain mutants with and without the 
presence of Fc fragment and Figure 7B shows the difference in FE between the two conditions. In Figure 7A, the 
difference in FE upon addition of Fc for a number of B1 domain variants with mutations in the binding site is presented. 
The experiments were conducted at 22 °C, pH 6 in the presence of 0.75 M GdmCl with an exchange time of 90 minutes. 
In Figure 7A, FE in the absence is represented by open bars and presence of 10 PM Fc fragment is represented by 
closed bars. Figure 7B presents the difference in FE (∆FE) in the absence and presence of Fc fragment. The numbers 
represent previously published dissociation constants (Sloan &amp; Hellinga, 1999). 
[0141] Mutants that cannot bind the Fc fragment do not gain additional protection against exchange and display no 
change in FE. Such an experimental design can also provide information about possible stability changes caused by 
the mutations. If a mutation significantly destabilizes the B1 domain, the FE in the absence of Fc fragment would be 
altered compared to WT*. In the case of these mutations, the changes in FE in the presence of Fc are due primarily to 
changes in the binding energy rather than destabilization of the B1 domain. Thus, the present invention can be employed 
to study the effect of a mutation on protein stability.

IX. Method of Quantitatively Determining the Stability of an Unpurified Test Protein (SUPREX) 

[0142] The SUPREX (Stability of Unpurified Proteins from Rates of H/D EXchange) methods, an aspect of the present 
invention, can be used to rapidly screen a large number of protein samples for the presence of stable structure. SUPREX 
refers to MALDI MS-HX methods employed in the study of unpurified protein samples. Like the MALDI MS-HX methods 
generally, the SUPREX methods employs hydrogen exchange coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization 
(MALDI) mass spectrometry to obtain quantitative measurements of stability from crude extracts of cell cultures, which 
can be grown in 96 well microtiter plates. Thus, SUPREX offers all the advantages of the MALDI MS-HX methods, with 
the additional advantage that SUPREX does not require that a test protein sample be purified before it is analyzed. 
[0143] As noted above, labile hydrogen atoms can exchange freely with the surrounding solvent. The overall structure 
of a protein, however, can protect a subset of these hydrogens from exchange (Hvidt &amp; Nielson, (1996) Adv. Protein 
Chem. 21: 287-386). The stability of a protein can be analyzed by monitoring the exchange rates of these "globally 
protected" hydrogens (Huyghues Despointes et al., (1999) Nat. Struct. Biol. 6: 910-12). Protein hydrogen exchange 
rates have historically been observed by techniques which allow the labile protons of a protein to exchange with D 2 O, 
in an hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HX) reaction. The exchange reaction has traditionally been monitored by nuclear 
magnetic resonance-based techniques (Englander et al., (1996) Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 6: 18-23). 
[0144] Recent studies have demonstrated that hydrogen exchange coupled with electrospray ionization (ESI) mass 
spectrometry can qualitatively distinguish native-like proteins from unfolded polypeptides in partially purified samples 
(Rosenbaum et al., (1999) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 121: 9509-13) and can be used to study the kinetics and thermodynamics 
of folding (Miranker et al., (1996) FASEB J. 10: 93-101; Deng &amp; Smith, (1999) Anal. Biochem. 276: 150-60). In contrast, 
the techniques described in the present invention employ MALDI mass spectrometry to detect hydrogen exchange. 
MALDI is ideally suited for fast, high throughput screening because a large number of samples can be analyzed in a 
short period of time. Notably, the MALDI technique is tolerant of impure samples that contain moderate levels of salts 
and other small molecule contaminants (Beavis &amp; Chait, (1996) Method Enzymol. 270: 519-51). This feature allows the 
measurement of hydrogen exchange as a function of denaturant concentration to give a quantitative measurement of 
the protein stability. 

IX.A. Sample Preparation in SUPREX Methods 

[0145] The protocol for employing the SUPREX methodology is generally the same as that described above for the 
MALDI MS-HX methods. However, when preparing samples for a SUPREX experiment, the protein samples need not 
be purified. Initially, samples are prepared. Suitable preparation steps are disclosed herein and can comprise overex-
pressing a protein of interest in bacterial cells and lysing the cells. Steps for overexpressing a protein of interest in 
bacterial or other cell type and lysing of the cell are well known and described in the literature (e.g., Sambrook et al., 
(1992) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, New York). Generally, a gene encoding a test 
protein can be cloned into a expression vector, such as a T7 expression vector, and expressed in cells, such as E. Coli 
strain BL21-(DE3) cells. Cultures can be conveniently grown on LB or other medium. If desired, the cultures can be 
disposed on a support such as a plastic 96 well microtiter plate. 
[0146] Expression of the test protein can be induced by the addition of IPTG or other compound. Cells can then be 
pelleted and lysed using a lysis solution, such as a BUGBUSTER™ solution, available from Novagen, Madison, Wis-
consin. The SUPREX methods do not require a purification step. Hydrogen exchange can then be initiated. 
[0147] Hydrogen exchange can be initiated by adding 10-fold excess or other desired amount of deuterated exchange 
buffer to the lysed cultures or the purified test protein. A series of exchange buffers can be made up comprising different 
concentrations of a denaturant, such as guanidinium chloride (GdmCl). The lysed cultures or purified protein is then 
allowed to exchange for a desired period of time (e.g. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 70, 80, or 120 minutes), 
the exchange time t. 
[0148] When particularly high sensitivity is desired, protein samples can be subjected to a micro-concentration step 
after H/D exchange and prior to MALDI analysis. Such a micro-concentration step can involve a batch chromatography 
method utilizing small reverse phase chromatography columns, such as 10 PL C 18 SUPROTIPS™ available from AmiKa 
(Columbia, Maryland). Preferably, the H/D exchange reaction is quenched with TFA (0.25 % v/v) prior to binding deu-
terated protein samples to the columns. This quenching helps to preserve the deuteration state of the protein. Binding 
of a test protein to the column can be achieved by repeatedly pipetting a 2 PL aliquot into the column, waiting five 
seconds, and expelling the aliquot to waste. The column can then be rinsed with a 2 PL aliquot of an ice-cold, aqueous 
solution comprising 5% MeOH and 0.1 %TFA in order to wash away excess denaturant. Finally, the test protein can be 
eluted from the column and directly onto a MALDI sample stage using approximately 1 Pl of the ice-cold MALDI matrix 
solution. 
[0149] When the exchange period has elapsed, an aliquot of the exchange reaction is added to a volume of a solution 
comprising a MALDI matrix compound (the matrix solution). A preferred matrix compound in the present invention is 


EP 1 307 736 B1

sinapinic acid. Although the composition of a matrix solution can vary with the matrix compound itself, a matrix solution 
for sinapinic acid can comprise a saturated solution of sinapinic acid in 45% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (pH 
3.0), which is preferably kept on ice (2 °C) prior to the addition of the protein. The addition of the deuterated sample to 
the matrix solution unfolds the protein and causes a fixed number of deuterons to re-exchange with protons. Experimental 
data indicate that the remaining deuterons are relatively stable and re-exchange at a slower rate of 0.001 s -1 (Figure 
1A). Once the matrix forms a solid crystal, the exchange rate slows to a rate of 0.001 min -1 (Figure 1B). By rapidly drying 
the sample on a MALDI target, the slowly exchanging deuterons are trapped in the time frame of the experiment and 
their number can be determined from a mass spectrum (Figure 2A). 
[0150] A reference protein can also be added to the matrix solution, when highly accurate mass measurements are 
desired. Suitable reference proteins can be bovine serum albumin (BSA), lysozyme or a biosynthetic nonnatural polypep-
tide. The mass of the test protein can then determined employing the reference protein as an internal standard. 

IX.B. Data Acquisition in the SUPREX Methods 

[0151] A difference between the SUPREX and MALDI MS-HX methods is the preparation of the sample; data can be 
acquired in the SUPREX methods in the same fashion as described above for the MALDI MS-HX methods. Following 
incubation of the test protein with the matrix, an aliquot of the solution is then placed on a MALDI target and rapidly dried 
under an air stream. Preferably, aliquots are placed in the matrix and dried within 1 minute. For a given data point, 
multiple MALDI spectra can be analyzed and the results averaged. Protein concentrations in each spot can range 
between 0.1 and 1 pmol of protein, however as mass spectrometry technology improves, smaller concentrations, such 
as attomole amounts of sample can be analyzed. Thus, there is effectively no limit on the amount of protein analyzed 
using the methods of the present invention. MALDI MS spectra of the sample can then be acquired, providing information 
regarding the mass of a test protein. Mass spectra can be collected on any mass spectrometer, (the VOYAGER® 
Biospectrometry Workstation, available from PerSeptive Biosystems Inc. of Framingham, Massachusetts is a preferred 
mass spectrometer). Spectra can be acquired in positive ion mode and summed over 32 (or other desired number) laser 
shots. 

IX.C. Application of the SUPREX Methods 

[0152] As a demonstration that the SUPREX method of the present invention is capable of accurately measuring 
stability perturbations caused by mutations, SUPREX assays were performed on a series of λ 6-85 variants known to 
have different stabilities (Huang &amp; Oas, (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 92: 6878-82; Burton et al., (1996) J. Mol. 
Biol. 263: 311-22; Burton et al., (1997) Nat. Struct. Biol. 4: 305-10). The SUPREX methods of the present invention can 
be employed to detect stability perturbations by employing the following general procedure. Those of skill in the art will 
recognize that the following procedure is presented for a given set of proteins and can be employed in the study of other 
proteins, mutatis mudandis. 
[0153] In these experiments, hydrogen/ deuterium exchange was performed at room temperature and pH 6.7 for 60 
minutes. Figures 4A-4H depicts the generated stability curves for this set of proteins. The curves of Figures 4A-4H are 
arranged in order of the stability of the mutant, from the least to the most stable: (A) A66G; (B) A63G; (C) WT; (D) 
G46A/G48A/A66G; (E) G46A/G48A/A49G; (F) Q33Y; (G) G46A/G48A; (H) Q33Y/G46A/G48A. Stabilizing mutations 
shift the titration curves to higher GdmCl concentrations. Table 1 compares the calculated ∆G f values obtained by 
SUPREX analysis of the crude samples of wild type λ 6-85 , the G46A/G48 variant and MBP with published values obtained 
by conventional CD denaturation curves of the purified proteins under similar conditions. Table 1 also lists the calculated 
change in ∆G f values relative to wild type proteins (∆∆G F ) for a series of λ 6-85 variants whose stabilities were determined 
at either 25 or 37 °C by conventional methods (Burton et al., (1997) Nat. Struct. Biol. 4: 305-10). Protein-dependent 
variations in &lt;k int &gt; values (Clarke &amp; Fersht, (1996) Fold Des. 1: 243-54), and the uncertainty involved in estimating m 
values introduces systematic errors in the SUPREX ∆G f estimates. However, since variants of a protein have nearly 
identical &lt;k int &gt; and m values, this error does not affect the ∆∆G f measurements. Thus, even in the absence of exact 
&lt;k int &gt; and m values, the SUPREX techniques of the present invention can accurately determine the change in ∆G f . The 
results in Table 1 show a good correlation between the stability changes measured by CD denaturation and SUPREX. 

X. Method of Quantitatively Determining Global Stability 

[0154] In an aspect of the present invention, the global stability of a test protein can be quantitatively determined. 
When quantitatively determining the global stability of a test protein using the methods of the present invention, samples 
can be prepared as described above. Generally, suitable preparation steps are disclosed herein and can comprise 
overexpressing a protein of interest in bacterial cells and lysing the cells. Steps for overexpressing a protein of interest 
in bacterial or other cell type and lysing of the cell are well known and described in the literature (e.g., Sambrook et al., 


EP 1 307 736 B1 

28 

5 





















(1992) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, New York). Generally, a gene encoding a test 
protein can be cloned into a expression vector, such as a T7 expression vector, and expressed in cells, such as E. Coli 
strain BL21-(DE3) cells. Cultures can be conveniently grown on LB or other medium. If desired, the cultures can be 
disposed on a support such as a plastic 96 well microtiter plate. 
[0155] Expression of the test protein can be induced by the addition of IPTG or other compound. Cells can then be 
pelleted and lysed using a lysis solution, such as a BUGBUSTER™ solution, available from Novagen, Madison, Wis-
consin. Lysates can then be centrifuged and the test protein isolated using protein purification methods known to those 
of skill in the art. Alternatively, as described further herein below, the SUPREX methods do not require a purification 
step. Hydrogen exchange can then be initiated. 
[0156] Hydrogen exchange can be initiated by adding 10-fold excess or other desired amount of deuterated exchange 
buffer to the lysed cultures or the purified test protein. A series of exchange buffers can be made up comprising different 
concentrations of a denaturant, such as guanidinium chloride (GdmCl). The lysed cultures or purified protein is then 
allowed to exchange for a desired period of time (e.g. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 70, 80, or 120 minutes), 
the exchange time t. 
[0157] When particularly high sensitivity is desired, protein samples can be subjected to a micro-concentration step 
after H/D exchange and prior to MALDI analysis. Such a micro-concentration step can involve a batch chromatography 
method utilizing small reverse phase chromatography columns, such as 10 PL C 18 SUPROTIPS™ available from AmiKa 
(Columbia, Maryland). Preferably, the H/D exchange reaction is quenched with TFA (0.25 % v/v) prior to binding deu-
terated protein samples to the columns. This quenching helps to preserve the deuteration state of the protein. Binding 
of a test protein to the column can be achieved by repeatedly pipetting a 2 PL aliquot into the column, waiting five 
seconds, and expelling the aliquot to waste. The column can then be rinsed with a 2 PL aliquot of an ice-cold, aqueous 
solution comprising 5% MeOH and 0.1%TFA in order to wash away excess denaturant. Finally, the test protein can be 
eluted from the column and directly onto a MALDI sample stage using approximately 1 Pl of the ice-cold MALDI matrix 
solution. 
[0158] When the exchange period has elapsed, an aliquot of the exchange reaction is added to a volume of a solution 
comprising a MACDI matrix compound (the matrix solution). A preferred matrix compound in the present invention is 
sinapinic acid. Although the composition of a matrix solution can vary with the matrix compound itself, a matrix solution 
for sinapinic acid can comprise a saturated solution of sinapinic acid in 45% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (pH 
3.0), which is preferably kept on ice (2 °C) prior to the addition of the protein. The addition of the deuterated sample to 
the matrix solution unfolds the protein and causes a fixed number of deuterons to re-exchange with protons. Experimental 
data indicate that the remaining deuterons are relatively stable and re-exchange at a slower rate of 0.001 s -1 (Figure 
1A). Once the matrix forms a solid crystal, the exchange rate slows to a rate of 0.001 min -1 (Figure 1 B). By rapidly 
drying the sample on a MALDI target, the slowly exchanging deuterons are trapped in the time frame of the experiment 
and their number can be determined from a mass spectrum (Figure 2A). 
[0159] A reference protein can also be added to the matrix solution, when highly accurate mass measurements are 
desired. Suitable reference proteins can be bovine serum albumin (BSA), lysozyme or a biosynthetic nonnatural polypep-
tide. The mass of the test protein can then determined employing the reference protein as an internal standard. 
[0160] Following incubation of the test protein with the matrix, an aliquot of the solution is then placed on a MALDI 
target and rapidly dried under an air stream. Preferably, aliquots are placed in the matrix and dried within 1 minute. For 
a given data point, multiple MALDI spectra can be analyzed and the results averaged. Protein concentrations in each 
spot can range between 0.1 and 1 pmol of protein, however as mass spectrometry technology improves, smaller con-
centrations, such as attomole amounts of sample can be analyzed. Thus, there is effectively no limit on the amount of 
protein analyzed using the methods of the present invention. MALDI MS spectra of the sample can then be acquired, 
providing information regarding the mass of a test protein. Mass spectra can be collected on any mass spectrometer; 
(the VOYAGER® Biospectrometry Workstation, available from PerSeptive Biosystems Inc. of Framingham, Massachu-
setts is a preferred mass spectrometer). Spectra can be acquired in positive ion mode and summed over 32 (or other 
desired number) laser shots. 
[0161] As deuterium atoms replace protons during the hydrogen exchange period, the mass of the protein increases. 
The extent of exchange can be determined by monitoring the change in mass relative to a fully protonated sample 
(∆mass). The observed ∆ Mass is due to deuterated hydrogens that do not re-exchange in the protonated matrix. This 
set is restricted to the backbone amide hydrogens since they have the slowest intrinsic exchange rates among the 
exchangeable hydrogens. 
[0162] Under native conditions, most of these observable amide hydrogens do not provide global stability information 
because they exchange by local (partial) unfolding processes. However, the addition of denaturant enhances the relative 
contribution of global unfolding to the exchange rates because local unfolding mechanisms are less denaturant dependant 
(Mayo &amp; Baldwin, (1993) Science 262: 873-76; Bai et al., (1995) Science 269: 192-97). For this reason, many amide 
hydrogens exchange through a global unfolding mechanism at moderate denaturant concentrations below that required 
to significantly denature the protein.

[0163] Continuing with the example involving MBP, Figure 2B shows the exchange of maltose binding protein (MBP) 
as a function of time in the presence of different guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) concentrations. In Figure 2B, (•) = 0M; 
( ) = 1M; (s) = 2M; (∇) = 6M GdmCl. The amplitude of the 6M GdmCl curve shown in Figure 2B represents the total 
number of exchangeable hydrogens observable by SUPREX for MBP. Of these ∼230 hydrogens, ~100 exchange within 
one hour, in the absence of GdmCl. These ~100 protons are not globally protected under these conditions and exchange 
with deuterons relatively quickly. The remaining mass increase is due to backbone amide hydrogens that are more 
protected and exchange at a slower rate. The addition of GdmCl dramatically increases the exchange rate of these 
hydrogens through global unfolding (Mayo &amp; Baldwin, (1993) Science 262: 873-76; Bai et al., (1995) Science 269: 
192-97). Figure 3A depicts the mass spectra (the arrow indicates the population averaged mass of the singly charged 
state of MBP) and Figure 3B depicts the ∆ Mass of MBP after 60 minutes of exchange, as a function of GdmCl concentration 
in the presence and absence of 100 PM maltose. In Figure 3B, (K) indicates no maltose present and (•) indicates the 
presence of 100PM maltose. Both curves in Figure 3B indicate the cooperative unfolding of the protein induced by the 
addition of GdmCl. 

XI. Method of Identifying a Protein that Unfolds Through One or More Stable Intermediates 

[0164] As with all denaturation experiments, for the quantitative analysis of MALDI MS-HX data it is preferable that a 
protein under study unfolds in a cooperative, two-state process (Schellman, (1987) Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 16: 
115-37). If one or more stable intermediates are present, the data will not easily fit the MALDI MS-HX or SUPREX 
equations. In such cases, a multi-phasic titration curve is observed or the transition is broadened. Under these conditions, 
an extrapolated stability measurement is difficult. However, the midpoint of the curve still serves as a good qualitative 
gauge of stability. Multi-phasic or broadened MALDI MS-HX or SUPREX curves might give poor fits using predicted m 
values. However, this method can be employed to identify proteins that have stable folding intermediates. 
[0165] Initially, samples are prepared. Suitable preparation steps are disclosed herein and can comprise overexpress-
ing a test protein suspected of unfolding through one or more intermediates in bacterial cells and lysing the cells. Steps 
for overexpressing a test protein suspected of unfolding through one or more intermediates or other protein of interest 
in bacterial or other cell type and lysing of the cell are well known and described in the literature (e.g.; Sambrook et al., 
(1992) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, New York). Generally, a gene encoding a test 
protein suspected of unfolding through one or more intermediates can be cloned into a expression vector, such as a T7 
expression vector, and expressed in cells, such as E. Coli strain BL21-(DE3) cells. Cultures can be conveniently grown 
on LB or other medium. If desired, the cultures can be disposed on a support such as a plastic 96 well microtiter plate. 
[0166] Expression of the test protein can be induced by the addition of IPTG or other compound. Cells can then be 
pelleted and lysed using a lysis solution, such as a BUGBUSTER™ solution, available from Novagen, Madison, Wis-
consin. Lysates can then be centrifuged and the test protein isolated using protein purification methods known to those 
of skill in the art. Alternatively, as described further herein below, the SUPREX methods do not require a purification 
step. Hydrogen exchange can then be initiated. 
[0167] Hydrogen exchange can be initiated by adding 10-fold excess or other desired amount of deuterated exchange 
buffer to the lysed cultures or the purified test protein. A series of exchange buffers can be made up comprising different 
concentrations of a denaturant, such as guanidinium chloride (GdmCl). The lysed cultures or purified protein is then 
allowed to exchange for a desired period of time (e.g. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 70, 80, or 120 minutes), 
the exchange time t. 
[0168] When particularly high sensitivity is desired, protein samples can be subjected to a micro-concentration step 
after H/D exchange and prior to MALDI analysis. Such a micro-concentration step can involve a batch chromatography 
method utilizing small reverse phase chromatography columns, such as 10 PL C 18 SUPROTIPS™ available from AmiKa 
(Columbia, Maryland). Preferably, the H/D exchange reaction is quenched with TFA (0.25 % v/v) prior to binding deu-
terated protein samples to the columns. This quenching helps to preserve the deuteration state of the protein. Binding 
of a test protein to the column can be achieved by repeatedly pipetting a 2 PL aliquot into the column, waiting five 
seconds, and expelling the aliquot to waste. The column can then be rinsed with a 2 PL aliquot of an ice-cold, aqueous 
solution comprising 5% MeOH and 0.1%TFA in order to wash away excess denaturant. Finally, the test protein can be 
eluted from the column and directly onto a MALDI sample stage using approximately 1 Pl of the ice-cold MALDI matrix 
solution. 
[0169] When the exchange period has elapsed, an aliquot of the exchange reaction is added to a volume of a solution 
comprising a MALDI matrix compound (the matrix solution). A preferred matrix compound in the present invention is 
sinapinic acid. Although the composition of a matrix solution can vary with the matrix compound itself, a matrix solution 
for sinapinic acid can comprise a saturated solution of sinapinic acid in 45% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (pH 
3.0), which is preferably kept on ice (2 °C) prior to the addition of the protein. The addition of the deuterated sample to 
the matrix solution unfolds the protein and causes a fixed number of deuterons to re-exchange with protons. Experimental 
data indicate that the remaining deuterons are relatively stable and re-exchange at a slower rate of 0.001 s -1 (Figure 


EP 1 307 736 B1

1A). Once the matrix forms a solid crystal, the exchange rate slows to a rate of 0.001 min -1 (Figure 1B). By rapidly drying 
the sample on a MALDI target, the slowly exchanging deuterons are trapped in the time frame of the experiment and 
their number can be determined from a mass spectrum (Figure 2A). 
[0170] A reference protein can also be added to the matrix solution, when highly accurate mass measurements are 
desired. Suitable reference proteins can be bovine serum albumin (BSA), lysozyme or a biosynthetic nonnatural polypep-
tide. The mass of the test protein can then determined employing the reference protein as an internal standard. 
[0171] Following incubation of the test protein with the matrix, an aliquot of the solution is then placed on a MALDI 
target and rapidly dried under an air stream. Preferably, aliquots are placed in the matrix and dried within 1 minute. For 
a given data point, multiple MALDI spectra can be analyzed and the results averaged. Protein concentrations in each 
spot can range between 0.1 and 1 pmol of protein, however as mass spectrometry technology improves, smaller con-
centrations, such as attomole amounts of sample can be analyzed. Thus, there is effectively no limit on the amount of 
protein analyzed using the methods of the present invention. MALDI MS spectra of the sample can then be acquired, 
providing information regarding the mass of a test protein. Mass spectra can be collected on any mass spectrometer, 
(the VOYAGER® Biospectrometry Workstation, available from PerSeptive Biosystems Inc. of Framingham, Massachu-
setts is a preferred mass spectrometer). Spectra can be acquired in positive ion mode and summed over 32 (or other 
desired number) laser shots. 
[0172] Data analysis can comprise a qualitative evaluation of a generated unfolding curve. If the unfolding curve 
demonstrates multi-phasic attributes, the curve is indicative of the possible presence of stable intermediates. Methods 
of visual identification of multi-phasic attributes in an unfolding curve are documented will be known to those of skill in 
the art. 
[0173] Another consideration in the quantitative analysis of MALDI MS-HX and SUPREX data is the tendency of some 
proteins to enter the EX1 regime at high denaturant concentrations and/or pH (Clarke &amp; Fersht, (1996) Fold Des. 1: 
243-54; Loh et al., (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 93: 1982-87; Yi et al., (1997) Fold Des. 2: 271-80). Under such 
conditions, the intrinsic exchange rate is greater than the folding rate and the exchange rate becomes the function of 
the unfolding rate rather the folding equilibrium constant. This situation can cause distortions in the MALDI MS-HX and 
SUPREX curves and it would be difficult to properly analyze the data without knowledge of and accounting for the 
denaturant dependence of the unfolding rate. In practice, as is the case with MBP and λ 6-85 , MALDI MS-HX and SUPREX 
measurements will preferably be acquired at lower denaturant concentrations and pH where EX1 conditions usually do 
not prevail. 

XII. Method of Detecting a Disease Characterized by Protein Misfolding 

[0174] The methods of the present invention can be employed to detect a disease characterized by protein misfolding. 
Protein misfolding disorders are a common component of numerous genetic disease states including, but not limited to, 
cystic fibrosis, familial hypercholesterolemia, retinitis pigmentosa, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and a1-antitrypsin misfold-
ing. Reduced protein stability can lead to aggregation, amyloid formation, degradation and general lack of function in 
vivo (McLendon &amp; Radany, (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253: 6335-37; Jaenicke, (1987) Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 49: 117-237; 
Parsell &amp; Sauer, (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264: 7590-95; Betton &amp; Hofnung, (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271: 8046-52; Dobson, 
(1999) Trends Biochem. Sci. 24: 329-32). There is also growing evidence that protein stabilization can also be detrimental 
to function (Varley &amp; Pain, (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 220: 531-38; Shoichet et al., (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 92: 
452-56). These observations suggest that thermodynamic stability is an important regulatory trait that has evolved to 
an optimal level to fit the functional needs of individual proteins. 
[0175] In this application of the present invention, protein misfolding is identified by an alteration in stability, which can 
be detected as a function of a change in mass of a test protein, as compared with a reference, properly folded protein. 
As more and more disease states characterized by protein misfolding are identified, the present invention will find 
extensive applicability to identify these problems. 
[0176] In the context of detecting the presence of a disease characterized by protein misfolding, a test protein will 
typically be a protein known to misfold, giving rise to the disease state. For example, it is known that the deletion of F508 
from the cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor (CFTR) contributes to the condition cystic fibrosis. In this case, a suitable 
test protein is CTFR. 
[0177] In the method of detecting a disease characterized by protein misfolding of the present invention, a test protein 
is first provided. Suitable preparation steps are disclosed herein and can comprise overexpressing a test protein suspected 
of being misfolded in bacterial cells and lysing the cells. Steps for overexpressing a test protein suspected of being 
misfolded or any protein of interest in bacterial or other cell type and lysing of the cell are well known and described in 
the literature (e.g., Sambrook et al., (1992) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, New York). 
Generally, a gene encoding a test protein can be cloned into a expression vector, such as a T7 expression vector, and 
expressed in cells, such as E. Coli strain BL21-(DE3) cells. Cultures can be conveniently grown on LB or other medium. 
If desired, the cultures can be disposed on a support such as a plastic 96 well microtiter plate.

[0178] Expression of the test protein can be induced by the addition of IPTG or other compound. Cells can then be 
pelleted and lysed using a lysis solution, such as a BUGBUSTER™ solution, available from Novagen, Madison, Wis-
consin. Lysates can then be centrifuged and the test protein isolated using protein purification methods known to those 
of skill in the art. Alternatively, as described further herein below, the SUPREX methods do not require a purification 
step. Hydrogen exchange can then be initiated. 
[0179] Hydrogen exchange can be initiated by adding 10-fold excess or other desired amount of deuterated exchange 
buffer to the lysed cultures or the purified test protein. A series of exchange buffers can be made up comprising different 
concentrations of a denaturant, such as guanidinium chloride (GdmCI). The lysed cultures or purified protein is then 
allowed to exchange for a desired period of time (e.g. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 70, 80, or 120 minutes), 
the exchange time t. 
[0180] When particularly high sensitivity is desired, protein samples can be subjected to a micro-concentration step 
after H/D exchange and prior to MALDI analysis. Such a micro-concentration step can involve a batch chromatography 
method utilizing small reverse phase chromatography columns, such as 10 PL C 18 SUPROTIPS™ available from AmiKa 
(Columbia, Maryland). Preferably, the H/D exchange reaction is quenched with TFA (0.25 % v/v) prior to binding deu-
terated protein samples to the columns. This quenching helps to preserve the deuteration state of the protein. Binding 
of a test protein to the column can be achieved by repeatedly pipetting a 2 PL aliquot into the column, waiting five 
seconds, and expelling the aliquot to waste. The column can then be rinsed with a 2 PL aliquot of an ice-cold, aqueous 
solution comprising 5% MeOH and 0.1 %TFA in order to wash away excess denaturant. Finally, the test protein can be 
eluted from the column and directly onto a MALDI sample stage using approximately 1 Pl of the ice-cold MALDI matrix 
solution. 
[0181] When the exchange period has elapsed, an aliquot of the exchange reaction is added to a volume of a solution 
comprising a MALDI matrix compound (the matrix solution). A preferred matrix compound in the present invention is 
sinapinic acid. Although the composition of a matrix solution can vary with the matrix compound itself, a matrix solution 
for sinapinic acid can comprise a saturated solution of sinapinic acid in 45% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (pH 
3.0), which is preferably kept on ice (2 °C) prior to the addition of the protein. The addition of the deuterated sample to 
the matrix solution unfolds the protein and causes a fixed number of deuterons to re-exchange with protons. Experimental 
data indicate that the remaining deuterons are relatively stable and re-exchange at a slower rate of 0.001 s -1 (Figure 
1A). Once the matrix forms a solid crystal, the exchange rate slows to a rate of 0.001 min -1 (Figure 1 B). By rapidly 
drying the sample on a MALDI target, the slowly exchanging deuterons are trapped in the time frame of the experiment 
and their number can be determined from a mass spectrum (Figure 2A). 
[0182] A reference protein can also be added to the matrix solution, when highly accurate mass measurements are 
desired. Suitable reference proteins can be bovine serum albumin (BSA), lysozyme or a biosynthetic nonnatural polypep-
tide. The mass of the test protein can then determined employing the reference protein as an internal standard. 
[0183] Following incubation of the test protein with the matrix, an aliquot of the solution is then placed on a MALDI 
target and rapidly dried under an air stream. Preferably, aliquots are placed in the matrix and dried within 1 minute. For 
a given data point, multiple MALDI spectra can be analyzed and the results averaged. Protein concentrations in each 
spot can range between 0.1 and 1 pmol of protein, however as mass spectrometry technology improves, smaller con-
centrations, such as attomole amounts of sample can be analyzed. Thus, there is effectively no limit on the amount of 
protein analyzed using the methods of the present invention. MALDI MS spectra of the sample can then be acquired, 
providing information regarding the mass of a test protein. Mass spectra can be collected on any mass spectrometer, 
(the VOYAGER® Biospectrometry Workstation, available from PerSeptive Biosystems Inc. of Framingham, Massachu-
setts is a preferred mass spectrometer). Spectra can be acquired in positive ion mode and summed over 32 (or other 
desired number) laser shots. 
[0184] The observed stability is then compared with a known stability of a properly folded test protein. To continue 
with the example of CFTR, a properly folded test protein could be a CFTR polypeptide wherein the F508 deletion is 
absent. The stability of a properly folded test protein can be measured using the MALDI MS-HX and SUPREX methods 
of the present invention, or, if available, the stability of a properly folded test protein can determined by examination of 
the appropriate literature. 
[0185] Differences in the known and observed stabilities of a test protein can be indicative of the presence of a disease 
state. Typically, misfolded proteins can exhibit altered stabilities. If the observed and known stabilities of a test protein 
are very similar, it is possible that the disease state is not present in the organism that is the source of the test protein. 
[0186] The SUPREX methods will be particularly useful for this application. The ability of SUPREX to tolerate impure 
samples makes it amenable to high throughput, automated screening. In this embodiment, SUPREX can be employed 
to many samples in a short period of time, potentially facilitating early diagnosis of the presence of such a disease condition. 

XIII. Method of Detecting an Improperly Folded Mutant Test Protein 

[0187] The MALDI MS-HX and SUPREX methods of the present invention can be employed to detect a properly folded 


EP 1 307 736 B1

5 





















mutant test protein. Such a detection can be based on an assessment of the stability of a mutant test protein. The 
methods of the present invention can facilitate a detection of the stability of an improperly (or properly) folded mutant 
test protein by observing a change in mass of a mutant test protein, which can be detected following H/D exchange in 
the mutant test protein. 
[0188] It is known that a protein that is misfolded can exhibit variations in stability, compared with the properly folded 
form of the protein. Such misfolding can be caused by a mutation (which can be spontaneous or engineered) in the 
amino acid sequence of the protein. An understanding of this principle, coupled with the methods of the present invention, 
can therefore be used to detect properly (and improperly) folded mutant proteins. The ability to detect improperly (and 
properly) folded mutant proteins can be of great benefit to those researchers working the area of protein design as well 
as those performing basic research. 
[0189] A method for detecting an improperly folded mutant protein can follow the general steps of the MALDI MS-HX 
and SUPREX methods. Samples can be prepared as described herein above and in the Laboratory Examples. Suitable 
preparation steps are disclosed herein and can comprise overexpressing a mutant test protein in bacterial cells and 
lysing the cells. Steps for overexpressing mutant test protein or any protein of interest in bacterial or other cell type and 
lysing of the cell are well known and described in the literature (e.g., Sambrook et al., (1992) Molecular Cloning: A 
Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, New York). Generally, a gene encoding a mutant test protein can be cloned 
into a expression vector, such as a T7 expression vector, and expressed in cells, such as E. Coli strain BL21-(DE3) 
cells. Cultures can be conveniently grown on LB or other medium. If desired, the cultures can be disposed on a support 
such as a plastic 96 well microtiter plate. 
[0190] Expression of the mutant test protein can be induced by the addition of IPTG or other compound. Cells can 
then be pelleted and lysed using a lysis solution, such as a BUGBUSTER™ solution, available from Novagen, Madison, 
Wisconsin. Lysates can then be centrifuged and the test protein isolated using protein purification methods known to 
those of skill in the art. Alternatively, as described further herein below, the SUPREX methods do not require a purification 
step. Hydrogen exchange can then be initiated. 
[0191] Hydrogen exchange can be initiated by adding 10-fold excess or other desired amount of deuterated exchange 
buffer to the lysed cultures or the purified test protein. A series of exchange buffers can be made up comprising different 
concentrations of a denaturant, such as guanidinium chloride (GdmCl). The lysed cultures or purified protein is then 
allowed to exchange for a desired period of time (e.g. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 70, 80, or 120 minutes), 
the exchange time t. 
[0192] When particularly high sensitivity is desired, protein samples can be subjected to a micro-concentration step 
after H/D exchange and prior to MALDI analysis. Such a micro-concentration step can involve a batch chromatography 
method utilizing small reverse phase chromatography columns, such as 10 PL C 18 SUPROTIPS™ available from AmiKa 
(Columbia, Maryland). Preferably, the H/D exchange reaction is quenched with TFA (0.25 % v/v) prior to binding deu-
terated protein samples to the columns. This quenching helps to preserve the deuteration state of the protein. Binding 
of a test protein to the column can be achieved by repeatedly pipetting a 2 PL aliquot into the column, waiting five 
seconds, and expelling the aliquot to waste. The column can then be rinsed with a 2 PL aliquot of an ice-cold, aqueous 
solution comprising 5% MeOH and 0.1%TFA in order to wash away excess denaturant. Finally, the test protein can be 
eluted from the column and directly onto a MALDI sample stage using approximately 1 Pl of the ice-cold MALDI matrix 
solution. 
[0193] When the exchange period has elapsed, an aliquot of the exchange reaction is added to a volume of a solution 
comprising a MALDI matrix compound (the matrix solution). A preferred matrix compound in the present invention is 
sinapinic acid. Although the composition of a matrix solution can vary with the matrix compound itself, a matrix solution 
for sinapinic acid can comprise a saturated solution of sinapinic acid in 45% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (pH 
3.0), which is preferably kept on ice (2 °C) prior to the addition of the protein. The addition of the deuterated sample to 
the matrix solution unfolds the protein and causes a fixed number of deuterons to re-exchange with protons. Experimental 
data indicate that the remaining deuterons are relatively stable and re-exchange at a slower rate of 0.001 s -1 (Figure 
1A). Once the matrix forms a solid crystal, the exchange rate slows to a rate of 0.001 min -1 (Figure 1 B). By rapidly 
drying the sample on a MALDI target, the slowly exchanging deuterons are trapped in the time frame of the experiment 
and their number can be determined from a mass spectrum (Figure 2A). 
[0194] A reference protein can also be added to the matrix solution, when highly accurate mass measurements are 
desired. Suitable reference proteins can be bovine serum albumin (BSA), lysozyme or a biosynthetic nonnatural polypep-
tide. The mass of the mutant test protein can then determined employing the reference protein as an internal standard. 
[0195] Following incubation of the mutant test protein with the matrix, an aliquot of the solution is then placed on a 
MALDI target and rapidly dried under an air stream. Preferably, aliquots are placed in the matrix and dried within 1 
minute. For a given data point, multiple MALDI spectra can be analyzed and the results averaged. Protein concentrations 
in each spot can range between 0.1 and 1 pmol of protein, however as mass spectrometry technology improves, smaller 
concentrations, such as attomole amounts of sample can be analyzed. Thus, there is effectively no limit on the amount 
of protein analyzed using the methods of the present invention. MALDI MS spectra of the sample can then be acquired,

providing information regarding the mass of a mutant test protein. Mass spectra can be collected on any mass spec-
trometer, (the VOYAGER® Biospectrometry Workstation, available from PerSeptive Biosystems Inc. of Framingham, 
Massachusetts is a preferred mass spectrometer). Spectra can be acquired in positive ion mode and summed over 32 
(or other desired number) laser shots. 
[0196] Stability measurements can be indicative of the folding state of a protein. Thus, to detect an improperly folded 
mutant test protein, the observed stability of the protein can be compared with the stability of a properly folded unmutated 
form of the mutant test protein. That is, the observed stability can be compared with the stability of a form of the protein 
that is not mutated and/or is known to fold properly. The stability of a properly folded form of a mutant test protein can 
be determined using the methods of the present invention or can be obtained by reviewing the appropriate literature. If 
a comparison of the known and observed stability values indicates that the two values are significantly different, this 
observation lends support to the conclusion that the mutant test protein is improperly folded. Conversely, if the two 
values are not significantly different, this observation lends support to the conclusion that the mutant test protein is 
properly folded. 

XIV. Method of Characterizing the Ligand Binding Profile and/or the Stability of an Uncharacterized Test Protein 

[0197] The time after the completion of the sequencing of the human genome has come to be known as the Proteomic 
Era. In this phase of post-genomic biology, biomedical research will be primarily focused on the characterization, ma-
nipulation and therapeutic development of proteins, the biomolecules for which most genes code. The ability to identify 
which, if any ligands a given protein associates with is an aspect of protein research. This ability is of particular interest 
when an unknown protein is studied, such as many of those identified, but not characterized, by the researchers of the 
human genome project. A critical step in the characterization of an uncharacterized protein is determining which ligands 
it binds, 
[0198] The ability to fold into a stable three dimensional structure is a crucial property of all functional proteins. Suc-
cessful protein research also depends upon this fundamental property. Prior to the development of the MALDI MS-HX 
and SUPREX methods of the present invention, there were no feasible methods available to quantitatively determine 
the stability of proteins, particularly those that were impure, such as those in unpurified cell lysates, or those that could 
only be isolated in such small quantities. Another critical step in the characterization of an uncharacterized protein is 
determining its stability. 
[0199] When determining the ligand binding profile of an uncharacterized protein, an uncharacterized test protein is 
initially prepared. Suitable preparation steps are disclosed herein and can comprise overexpressing an uncharacterized 
protein in bacterial cells and lysing the cells. Steps for overexpressing an uncharacterized test protein or any protein of 
interest in bacterial or other cell type and lysing of the cell are well known and described in the literature (e.g., Sambrook 
et al., (1992) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, New York). Generally, a gene encoding a 
test protein can be cloned into a expression vector, such as a T7 expression vector, and expressed in cells, such as E. 
Coli strain BL21-(DE3) cells. Cultures can be conveniently grown on LB or other medium. If desired, the cultures can 
be disposed on a support such as a plastic 96 well microtiter plate. 
[0200] Expression of the uncharacterized test protein can be induced by the addition of IPTG or other compound. 
Cells can then be pelleted and lysed using a lysis solution, such as a BUGBUSTER™ solution, available from Novagen, 
Madison, Wisconsin. Lysates can then be centrifuged and the uncharacterized test protein isolated using protein puri-
fication methods known to those of skill in the art. Alternatively, as described further herein below, the SUPREX methods 
do not require a purification step. When determining the ligand binding profile of an uncharacterized test protein, a test 
ligand is then contacted with the uncharacterized test protein for a selected period of time, such as 30 seconds, 1, 3 or 
5 minutes or other desired period of time. Hydrogen exchange can then be initiated. If the stability of an uncharacterized 
test protein is being determined, no test ligand need be contacted with the uncharacterized test protein. 
[0201] Hydrogen exchange can be initiated by adding 10-fold excess or other desired amount of deuterated exchange 
buffer to the lysed cultures, purified test protein or test ligand/ test protein mixture. A series of exchange buffers can be 
made up comprising different concentrations of a denaturant, such as guanidinium chloride (GdmCl). The lysed cultures 
or purified protein is then allowed to exchange for a desired period of time (e.g. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 
60, 70, 80, or 120 minutes), the exchange time t. 
[0202] When particularly high sensitivity is desired, protein samples can be subjected to a micro-concentration step 
after H/D exchange and prior to MALDI analysis. Such a micro-concentration step can involve a batch chromatography 
method utilizing small reverse phase chromatography columns, such as 10 PL C 18 SUPROTIPS™ available from AmiKa 
(Columbia, Maryland). Preferably, the H/D exchange reaction is quenched with TFA (0.25 % v/v) prior to binding deu-
terated protein samples to the columns. This quenching helps to preserve the deuteration state of the protein. Binding 
of a test protein to the column can be achieved by repeatedly pipetting a 2 PL aliquot into the column, waiting five 
seconds, and expelling the aliquot to waste. The column can then be rinsed with a 2 PL aliquot of an ice-cold, aqueous 
solution comprising 5% MeOH and 0.1 %TFA in order to wash away excess denaturant. Finally, the test protein can be

eluted from the column and directly onto a MALDI sample stage using approximately 1 Pl of the ice-cold MALDI matrix 
solution. 
[0203] When the exchange period has elapsed, an aliquot of the exchange reaction is added to a volume of a solution 
comprising a MALDI matrix compound (the matrix solution). A preferred matrix compound in the present invention is 
sinapinic acid. Although the composition of a matrix solution can vary with the matrix compound itself, a matrix solution 
for sinapinic acid can comprise a saturated solution of sinapinic acid in 45% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (pH 
3.0), which is preferably kept on ice (2 °C) prior to the addition of the protein. The addition of the deuterated sample to 
the matrix solution unfolds the uncharacterized test protein and causes a fixed number of deuterons to re-exchange with 
protons. Experimental data indicate that the remaining deuterons are relatively stable and re-exchange at a slower rate 
of 0.001 s -1 (Figure 1A). Once the matrix forms a solid crystal, the exchange rate slows to a rate of 0.001 min -1 (Figure 
1B). By rapidly drying the sample on a MALDI target, the slowly exchanging deuterons are trapped in the time frame of 
the experiment and their number can be determined from a mass spectrum (Figure 2A). 
[0204] A reference protein can also be added to the matrix solution; when highly accurate mass measurements are 
desired. Suitable reference proteins can be bovine serum albumin (BSA), lysozyme or a biosynthetic nonnatural polypep-
tide. The mass of the uncharacterized test protein can then determined employing the reference protein as an internal 
standard. 
[0205] Following incubation of the uncharacterized test protein (or test ligand/ test protein mixture) with the matrix, an 
aliquot of the solution is then placed on a MALDI target and rapidly dried under an air stream. Preferably, aliquots are 
placed in the matrix and dried within 1 minute. For a given data point, multiple MALDI spectra can be analyzed (e.g. 1, 
3, 5, 10 or any other desired number of spectra) and the results averaged. Protein concentrations in each spot can range 
between 0.1 and 1 pmol of protein, however as mass spectrometry technology improves, smaller concentrations, such 
as attomole amounts of sample can be analyzed. Thus, there is effectively no limit on the amount of uncharacterized 
test protein analyzed using the methods of the present invention. MALDI MS spectra of the sample can then be acquired, 
providing information regarding the mass of a test protein. Mass spectra can be collected on any mass spectrometer, 
(the VOYAGER® Biospectrometry Workstation, available from PerSeptive Biosystems Inc. of Framingham, Massachu-
setts is a preferred mass spectrometer). Spectra can be acquired in positive ion mode and summed over 32 (or other 
desired number) laser shots. 
[0206] The results with MBP show that SUPREX can detect binding through a change in protein stability. The ther-
modynamic linkage between stability and binding has been established (Schellman, (1975) Biopolymers 14: 999-1018; 
Pace &amp; McGrath, (1980) J Biol Chem 255, 3862-5). A large number of potential ligands can be rapidly screened for this 
effect. These ligands could be small molecules, proteins or nucleic acids. The SUPREX techniques of the present 
invention provide a convenient alternative in experiments where a binding assay is not available or difficult to employ. 
This approach can be applied to a method analogous to the yeast two-hybrid screen (Fields &amp; Song. (1989) Nature 340: 
245-46), in which two proteins of interest (e.g., a target and a library) are co-expressed and the target protein is screened 
for stability by the SUPREX techniques of the present invention. The methods of the present invention can also be 
modified to allow screening of large ligand libraries directly on MALDI plates with pre-deposited protein. The method 
can also be modified to allow screening of ligand bound to a solid support for protein binding. 
[0207] Using the above general method, the ligand binding profile and/or stability of an uncharacterized test protein 
can be determined. An advantage of the present inventive methods is that no prior knowledge of an uncharacterized 
test protein is required. Indeed, a goal of the present invention is to provide such information to researchers. Additionally, 
the present invention can be employed on unpurified samples, making it particularly suited for automation and high 
throughput screening. 

XV. Advantages of the Method of the Present Invention 

[0208] As noted herein above, the methods of the present invention can be employed to quantitatively measure binding 
constants. The methods of the present invention offer a range of advantages over prior art methods. Representative, 
non-limiting advantages of the present invention over prior art methods for the measurement of binding constants are 
disclosed herein below. 

XV.A. The Presence of a Denaturant Does Not Independently Affect the Binding Interaction 

[0209] One concern regarding the measurement of protein-protein binding constants with denaturation experiments 
is that the addition of denaturant can independently alter the dissociation constant. For example, the denaturant could 
unfold the substrate protein and thus nullify the interaction. Even if the denaturant does not unfold the substrate, it could 
interfere with binding by forming non specific interactions with the binding site. An advantage of the present invention 
compared to other denaturation techniques is that stability can be measured without resorting to high enough denaturant 
concentrations to unfold the protein. Although the plots in Figures 6A-6D show a sigmoidal transition, this does not 


EP 1 307 736 B1

5 





















correspond to the full unfolding of the protein as in typical denaturation experiments. As indicated by its stability and m 
value, B1 domain remains primarily folded in 3 M GdmCl. The Fc fragment, a much larger protein, is also likely to stay 
primarily folded in up to 3 M GdmCl. The data in Table 2 supports this conclusion. At shorter exchange times, the 
transition in the MALDI MS-HX curves occurs at higher denaturant concentrations. If the presence of GdmCl was strongly 
affecting the binding constant it would be expected that at shorter exchange times the binding-induced ∆∆G 0 
unfold would 
be lower. The fact that this phenomenon is not observed supports the conclusion that the presence of GdmCl does not 
independently affect the binding interaction and describes an advantage of the present invention over prior art method-
ology. 

XV.B. The Methods of the Present Invention Can Distinguish Between Stability and Interaction Energy 

[0210] The ability of the techniques of the present invention to distinguish between the two factors that can affect the 
observed binding (stability and interaction energy) is an asset. The binding affinities of the B1 mutants have been 
measured by fluorescence (Sloan &amp; Hellinga, (1999) Protein Sci. 8: 1643-48) and are presented in Figure 7A. It can be 
seen that these mutants that have a dissociation of less than 10 PM do not display a significant ∆FE under these set of 
conditions. In this aspect of the present invention, increasing the substrate concentration will lower the binding detection 
threshold. Since the addition of excess amounts of substrate typically will not interfere with mass analysis of the protein, 
very small binding constants can be measured. 
[0211] In the experimental setup described above, GdmCl was employed in order to make the exchange rate through 
the global mechanism more rapid. However, the inclusion of GdmCl might affect the binding constant of some protein 
systems. In such cases, the techniques of the present invention can be employed in combination with increasing the 
pH, temperature and exchange time, which will allow the data to be acquired at lower denaturant concentrations and 
permit distinguishing between these stability and interaction energy. The ability to distinguish between stability and 
interaction energy by varying these experimental parameters offer an advantage over prior art systems, because such 
systems do not offer this capability. 

XV.C. The Methods of the Present Invention Can be Performed on Crude Samples 

[0212] The methods of the present invention do not require that a protein of interest be purified, because MALDI can 
tolerate the excess presence of most impurities. In the experiments presented in Laboratory Example 2, for example, 
recombinant B1 domain was expressed in E. coli and was analyzed without any purification. This advantage of the 
present invention facilitates rapid binding analysis of a large number of recombinant proteins in a short period of time. 
The ability of the present invention to accommodate crude samples facilitates high-throughput analysis and makes the 
present invention ideal for large scale screening of protein binding. Additionally, the fact that the presence of other 
components can be readily tolerated also makes it possible to analyze binding in complex environments. For example, 
dissociation constants can be analyzed in cell extracts where the effects of tertiary components on binding are of interest. 

XV.D. The Methods of the Present Invention Can Measure a Wide Range of Dissociation Constants 

[0213] Another advantage of the methods of the present invention is that the invention makes it possible to measure 
exceedingly high or low dissociation constants. Very high dissociation constants can be measured because, as stated 
above, the change in FE can be measured in conditions where the substrate protein is in vast excess of the detected 
protein. This typically would not be possible if binding-induced stability changes were being detected by prior art spec-
troscopic techniques, such as fluorescence or circular dichroism. Very low dissociation constants can be measured 
because the concentration of the detected protein can be much higher than the dissociation constant. In typical, titration 
methods, such as Scatchard analysis, the concentration of the detected protein must be similar or less than the disso-
ciation constant (Segel, (1975) Enzyme Kinetics, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, New York). For very tight dissociation 
constants, the detection of the protein often becomes a limiting factor. However, when binding is being detected through 
stability changes using techniques of the present invention, the protein concentration can far exceed the dissociation 
constant. Thus, very tight binding can be analyzed without resorting to supersensitive detection methods. For example, 
in the experiments of Laboratory Example 2, nanomolar dissociation constants were measured, even though the con-
centration of B1 domain (the subject protein in this illustrative example) was in the micromolar range. 

XV.E. The Methods of the Present Invention Do Not Require Derivatization or Prior Knowledge of a Test Protein 

[0214] The methods of the present invention are a very simple, general and economical approach to analyzing binding 
and stability. In fact, no prior knowledge of the structure or function of the protein is necessary. The method is applicable 
for small molecule and macromolecular binding and can be used to analyze the binding of ligands to proteins (e.g. 


EP 1 307 736 B1 

36 

5 





















maltose to maltose binding protein), small molecule inhibitors to feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) protease, DNA to 
arc repressor and other protein-ligand sets. 
[0215] Additionally, no derivatization of a test protein is required. It is known that derivatization of a protein sample 
can alter its behavior and can generate misleading experimental results. This problem is obviated by the present inventive 
methods because no derivatization of a test protein is required. In fact, using the SUPREX methods of the present 
invention, a test protein can be studied in vivo, thus further limiting misleading experimental results. 
[0216] As disclosed herein, an application of the present invention is in the characterization of newly identified and/or 
uncharacterized proteins. As these proteins are uncharacterized, no knowledge of the protein's stability or binding profile 
is known. The ability to study uncharacterized proteins without derivatization is an advantage over prior art methods. 

XV.F. The Present Inventive Methods Require Small Quantities of Sample 

[0217] A disadvantage of conventional methods of measuring the thermodynamic stability of a protein is that these 
methods require relatively large amounts of pure protein. This limits the thermodynamic analysis of proteins to those 
that can be purified in large quantities. NMR-and calorimetry-based approaches typically require millimolar sample 
concentrations and milliliter sample volumes. Spectroscopy-based approaches that rely on optical techniques such as 
fluorescence or circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy generally require the least amount of sample to obtain a protein 
stability measurement, however, even these spectroscopy-based approaches can require micromolar sample concen-
trations and milliliter sample volumes. Unlike NMR and other techniques, the present invention is effective with very 
small amounts of sample. Additionally, very small quantities of protein can be analyzed without manipulation, such as 
labeling reactions (See Laboratory Example 4). 
[0218] Thus, the present invention discloses sensitive methods to quantitate the thermodynamic stability of a protein. 
The methods involve the use of H/D exchange methods, MALDI mass spectrometry, and optionally, a reversed-phase 
chromatography microconcentration step; therefore, it is generally applicable to proteins that are amenable to reversed-
phase chromatography and mass spectral analysis by MALDI. Significantly, the protocol reduces the amount of material 
required for measuring a protein's thermodynamic stability to the amount of material required to prepare a desired number 
of MALDI samples. Using standard MALDI sample preparation techniques and commercially available instrumentation 
this amount of material can be picomole amounts or, as mass spectrometry technology develops, attomole amounts. 
Several orders of magnitude less material is employed in the present inventive method than is required by conventional 
techniques that are currently used to measure a protein's thermodynamic stability. 
[0219] The use of more highly optimized MALDI sample preparation protocols could potentially further lower the 
amount of material required by the techniques of the present invention. For example, using pre-structured MALDI sample 
supports, it has recently been shown that it is possible to acquire MALDI mass spectra of proteins using as little as 100 
amol of material (Schuerendberg et al., (2000) Anal. Chem. 72: 3436-442). 

XV.G. The Present Inventive Method Can be Automated 

[0220] Although the data disclosed in the present invention was obtained by manual methods, the entire methodology 
of SUPREX can be easily automated and implemented for the analysis of a very large number of samples. For the 
experiments described in Laboratory Example 1 and herein above, the E. coli cultures were grown and induced on 96 
well plates. The exchange reaction and dilution into the matrix were also conducted in microtiter plates. The spotting of 
a sample onto a MALDI target from a microtiter well can also be done robotically and commercially available MALDI 
instruments can record the mass spectra of all the samples in quick succession. The analysis of the data can also be 
easily automated, in one aspect, by employing a computer program to analyze generated data. It is likely that a single 
person, with access to a MALDI instrument, could use the automated SUPREX techniques of the present invention to 
measure the stability of as many as 1000 proteins per day. 
[0221] Those of skill in the art will recognize that MBP and λ 6-85 , two exemplary proteins described in the present 
disclosure, are both fairly soluble proteins with high expression levels in E. coli, and thus very amenable to analysis. 
Poorly expressed proteins might be more difficult to visualize on a mass spectrum and might require an initial concentration 
procedure, such as a microconcentration step involving reverse phase chromatography as disclosed in the Laboratory 
Examples. Proteins that form aggregates in the lysate might also produce misleading results. Aggregation is likely to 
protect some hydrogens that are free to exchange in the monomeric soluble form thus creating artificially high observed 
stability. Complications might also arise if the recombinant protein requires some manipulation, such as reduction or 
renaturation for its folding. However, these complications can be minimized by the addition of moderate concentrations 
of denaturant sufficient to disaggregate or encourage proper disulfide bond formation but not high enough to unfold the 
protein. These are conditions under which SUPREX measurements using the present invention can be made. For this 
reason, the SUPREX techniques of the present invention can be useful even for proteins that are difficult to study by 
conventional methods.

XV.H. The Present Inventive Methods Can be Employed in High-Throughput Screening 

[0222] Combinatorial and directed-evolution methods have proven to be promising techniques for designing proteins 
of novel structure and function (Kamtekar et al., (1993) Science 262: 1680-85; Pace &amp; McGrath, (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 
255: 3862-65). These methods systematically generate a large number of sequences and it is imperative to be able to 
detect successful de novo designs from a large background of unfolded polypeptides. The ability to rapidly screen a 
large number of sequences for stable folding is crucial to the success of these methods. With its ease of use and high 
throughput capability, the MALDI MS-HX and SUPREX methods can perform this function and provide a fast convenient 
way to select for stable designs. High throughput screening preferably takes advantage of the ability to automate the 
data acquisition and data analysis methods of the present invention. 

XII.I. The Present Inventive Methods are Adaptable for Computer-based Data Analysis 

[0223] An additional advantage of the methods of the present invention includes the ability to easily analyze data 
generated by the methods. Often, data analysis can be complex, cumbersome and time consuming. The data of the 
present invention, however, are amenable to analysis by a computer program, thus simplifying the data analysis process 
and saving a researcher time and eliminating the possibility of human error in data analysis. 
[0224] When employing the methods of the present invention, a large number of mass spectra might require analysis. 
In an experiment, for example, it might be necessary to analyze 30 mass spectra collected from three different MALDI 
spots for each data point on a MALDI MS-HX or SUPREX stability curve. For a typical MALDI MS-HX curve, ten data 
points (300 spectra) are preferably collected. 
[0225] A computer program has been developed by the present co-inventors, and has been dubbed Rapid Analysis 
of Mass Spectrometry Information (RAMSI). The RAMSI program facilitates the rapid analysis of a large number of 
spectra with a user-friendly interface. As input, the program preferably accepts MALDI data in raw text format and outputs 
the average, calibrated mass of each data point, plots of the data and a helpful statistical analysis. Preferably, such a 
program also outputs the worked-up data in a form that is easy to import into other graphing programs. The program is 
preferably written for MATHEMATICA version 4 (Wolfram Research) and will run on any common platform. The program 
can also be written in C, C+, C++, FORTRAN or other suitable programming language. 
[0226] As an example, an experiment where sets of MALDI spectra were collected after exchange in deutrated buffers 
with varying concentrations of guanidinium hydrochloride (GdmCl) can be considered. The exchange can be conducted 
in the presence of 0 M, 0.25 M, 0.50 M, 0.75 M, 1.0 M, 1.50 M, 2.0 M, 3.0 M, 6.0 M GdmCl in deutrated buffers and also 
in protonated water. For each condition, 30 spectra can be collected, for a total of 300 spectra. Each of the 300 spectra 
are preferably exported as raw text in a two-column format, with the first column (x) representing m/z and the second 
column (y) representing the intensity. The filenames are preferably sequentially numbered. Documentation for the mass 
spectrometer which was used to collect the data can be consulted in order to determine the steps for exporting data in 
raw text. 
[0227] A RAMSI program preferably excises the regions of the spectrum corresponding to the sample peak and 
determines the m/z corresponding to the highest point in the peak. It is also preferable that the program allows smoothing 
of the peaks before the highest point is determined. Preferably, the program is configured so as to permit a user to tell 
the program to ignore any peak that does not meet a required intensity threshold. For the above example, 300 such 
graphics can be stored in a MATHEMATICA notebook, when the program is written for use with MATHEMATICA. A 
table can be produced, which presents the worked up mass of the sample peaks. This mass can be the calibrated or 
uncalibrated mass of a sample peak, depending on the instructions of the user. The program can be configured such 
that if the sample or calibration peaks do not meet the threshold requirements set by the user, a zero is inserted in the 
table. Preferably, a program also produces a statistical summary of the results. 
[0228] The program is preferably configured to then produce three plots. The first plot plots the masses for each data 
point separately. Since for each data point, the masses can be plotted in the order in which they were collected, this plot 
is useful for detecting possible back-exchange in the course of data collection. The second plot shows the range of the 
masses for each data point as a function of denaturant concentration. The third plot averages all the masses for each 
denaturant concentration and subtracts the mass of the water experiment from the rest of the data points. The result is 
a Amass vs [denaturant] plot. Preferably, a RAMSI program can also export generated tables for use by other programs. 

Laboratory Examples 

[0229] The following Laboratory Examples have been included to illustrate preferred modes of the invention. Certain 
aspects of the following Laboratory Examples are described in terms of techniques and procedures found or contemplated 
by the present inventors to work well in the practice of the invention. These Laboratory Examples are exemplified through 
the use of standard laboratory practices of the inventors. In light of the present disclosure and the general level of skill

in the art, those of skill will appreciate that the following Laboratory Examples are intended to be exemplary only and 
that numerous changes, modifications and alterations can be employed without departing from the spirit and scope of 
the invention. 

Laboratory Example 1 

Quantitative, High-Throughput Screen For Protein Stability 

1.A. Sample Preparation 

[0230] The gene encoding maltose binding protein or λ 6-85 was cloned into a T7 expression vector and expressed in 
E. Coli strain BL21-(DE3). 200 PL LB cultures of the recombinant E. Coli were grown in 96 well plates and induced by 
the addition of 0.4 mM isopropylthio-β-D-galactosidase (IPTG). The cells were subsequently pelleted and lysed by 
suspension in 10 PL BUG BUSTER™ solution (Novagen, Inc., Madison, Wisconsin). The lysates were centrifuged and 
the supernatant was used for hydrogen exchange experiments without any further manipulation. SDS-PAGE indicated 
that the crude samples comprised ~10%-50% expressed protein in a background of cellular impurities. From the gel, 
the concentrations of the proteins were estimated to range between 50 to 500 PM. 

1.B. Hydrogen Exchange 

[0231] Hydrogen exchange was initiated by adding 10-fold excess deuterated exchange buffer (20 mM sodium phos-
phate, 20 mM sodium acetate, 100 mM NaCl, pH 6.3 for MBP or pH 6.7 for λ 6-85 ) to the lysed cultures. The exchange 
buffers contained different concentrations of guanidinium chloride (GdmCl). At a given exchange time, 0.5 Pl of the 
exchange reaction was added to 50 Pl of matrix solution. The matrix used for these experiments was sinapinic acid. It 
was prepared as a saturated solution in 45% acetonitrile, 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid (pH 3.0) and was kept on ice (2 °C) 
prior to the addition of the protein. The choice of sinapinic acid as the MALDI matrix was critical because it was more 
tolerant than other MALDI matrices to the GdmCl used in the described experiments. In order to obtain highly accurate 
mass measurements, a reference protein was added to the matrix solution. The reference proteins used were bovine 
serum albumin (BSA) for the MBP experiments and a 10.0 kD biosynthetic non-natural polypeptide for the λ 6-85 exper-
iment. Once the sample protein was added to the matrix, 2 Pl of the solution was immediately placed on a MALDI target 
and rapidly dried under an air stream. Typically, the samples were placed in the matrix and dried within 1 minute. For a 
given data point, 5 MALDI spectra were analyzed and the results were averaged. No more than 10 minutes passed 
between matrix formation and data collection. It is estimated that the amount of protein in each spot ranged between 
0.1 and 1 pmol. 

1.C. Measurement of Back-exchange in the Protonated Matrix 

[0232] Control experiments were performed to measure the rate of exchange of protons from the matrix back into 
deuterated protein sites, both in the matrix solution and in the solid matrix crystals. To examine the exchange in the 
matrix solution, fully deuterated MBP was placed in a pre-chilled (2 °C) matrix solution. At given time intervals the sample 
was dried on a MALDI target and processed as described below. To examine the exchange in the solid matrix, fully 
deuterated MBP was placed in a pre-chilled (2°C) matrix solution and immediately dried on a MALDI target at room 
temperature. At given time intervals mass spectra were collected and processed. 

1.D. Data Collection 

[0233] Mass spectra were collected on a Voyager® Biospectrometry Workstation, available from PerSeptive Biosys-
tems Inc. of Framingham, Massachusetts, using the autosampler mode. All spectra were obtained in the positive ion 
mode and summed over 32 laser shots. 

1.E. Analysis Of SUPREX Data To Determine Protein Stability 

[0234] According to the classical hydrogen exchange model (Hvidt &amp; Nielson, (1966) Adv. Protein Chem. 21: 287-386): 


EP 1 307 736 B1

where k ex is the observed exchange rate for each hydrogen, k open and k close are the rate constants for the conformational 
changes leading to exchange competent and exchange incompetent states respectively and k int is the exchange rate 
for the unprotected hydrogen. Under EX2 conditions (where k close (or k open ) are much greater than k int ): 

where K open is the equilibrium constant between the exchange competent and exchange incompetent conformations of 
the protein (k open /k close ). For the hydrogens that are exchanging through a global unfolding mechanism, 

Substituting (3) into (2): 

Since k int is similar among the majority of the backbone amide hydrogens (Bai et al., (1993) Proteins 17: 75-86), the 
total exchange of the hydrogens that exchange through global unfolding can be estimated by a single rate constant. The 
increase in mass due to the exchange of globally exchanging protons (∆ Mass ) as a function of time can thus be estimated 
by the following first order rate equation: 

∆M o is ∆Mass before global exchange, ∆M is ∆Mass after complete exchange, t is the exchange time. Substitution of 

equation 5-4 into equation 5-5 gives an equation for ∆Mass vs. [GdmCl]: 

where (Pace, (1986) Methods Enzymol. 131: 266-80): 

∆G f is the free energy of folding in the absence of GdmCl, [GdmCI] is the guanidinium chloride concentration, m is δ∆G f / 
δ [GdmCl], R is the gas constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin. The m value determines the sharpness of the 

transition in the ∆ Mass vs. [GdmCl] plot. Myers et al. have shown that m values can be estimated from the size of the 
protein (Myers et al., (1995) Protein Sci. 4: 2138-48). The average GdmCl m value per residue for the 34 proteins in 
Table 5-1 of Myers et al. is 26 (σ=7.2) cal mol -1 M -1 per residue. According to this analysis, MBP and λ 6-85 are predicted 
to have m values of 9.7 2.6 and 2.1 0.6 kcal mol -1 M -1 . These measurements are close to the previously reported 
experimental m values (12 1 and 2.1 0.1 kcal mol -1 M -1 , respectively) measured from CD denaturation curves 
(Ghaemmaghami et al., (1998) Biochem. 37: 9179-85; Sheshadri et al., (1999) Protein Sci. 8: 1689-95). In order to 
assess the error involved in using estimated m values, as would be the case in a high-throughput screen of proteins, 
the calculated m values were used in this analysis. In equation 5-6, &lt;k int &gt; is the average exchange rate of unprotected 
amide hydrogens and is a function of pH and temperature. In principle, &lt;k int &gt; can be estimated by averaging the values 
for all the backbone amide hydrogens using the measurements of Englander et al. (Bai et al., (1993) Proteins 17: 75-86). 
However, for the described experiments, the simple relationship &lt;k int &gt;=10 pH-5 min -1 was used to estimate the rate at 
room temperature and pH &gt; 4. 
[0235] Referring now to the figures, Figures 1A and 1B demonstrate the effect of drying MBP, the test protein in this 
Laboratory Example, in an MS matrix, such as sinipanic acid, upon an H/D exchange rate. Figure 1B demonstrates that, 


EP 1 307 736 B1 

40 

5 





















upon fixation in an MS matrix, H/D exchange in the test protein effectively stops, in contradistinction to the data of Figure 
1A which indicates that there is a slow exchange occurring. Once the exchanging deuterons are "trapped" in the MS 
matrix, a MALDI MS spectrum can be acquired, as depicted in Figure 2A. Figures 1A-2B are representative of the MALDI 
MS-HX and SUPREX processes. For these figures, SUPREX was employed, as the samples were unpurified. Figure 
2B provides an indication of the number exchangeable hydrogens, as a function of the mass of the test protein, MBP. 
[0236] Turning next to Figures 3A and 3B, Figure 3A depicts the mass of the test protein when the test protein is 
incubated with various concentrations of denaturant. In this case, the denaturant is guanidinium hydrochloride. As the 
test protein unfolds thereby exposing a greater number of hydrogens, (with greater unfolding observed at higher denat-
urant concentrations) the mass of the test protein is seen to increase. In Figure 3B, the mass of the test protein is plotted 
as a function of denaturant concentration. Data was acquired for two cases: first, the test protein was incubated in the 
absence of ligand (maltose, a known ligand of MBP, in the present experiments) and second, the test protein was 
incubated in the presence of a ligand. The observed sigmoidal curves are indicative of a cooperative unfolding process. 
The unfolding curve is seen to shift to higher denaturant concentrations in the presence of maltose. Fitting the data to 
the equations derived herein above generates quantitative stability measurements, which are presented in Table 1. 
[0237] Finally, Figures 4A-4H show unfolding curves for a series of λ 6-85 variants known to have different stabilities. 
Stability measurements for this set of test proteins is presented in Table 1. 

Laboratory Example 2 SUPREX as a Tool for Measuring Protein-Protein Binding 

2.A. Mutagenesis And Protein Expression 

[0238] The genes for the B1 domain (Q32C) and its mutants were constructed as previously described (Sloan &amp; 
Hellinga, (1999) Protein Sci. 8: 1643-48) and cloned in the pKK223 expression vector (Pharmacia, Peapack, New Jersey). 
Mutations were constructed in the Q32C (WT*) background. The plasmids were transformed into XL1-Blue E coli and 
grown in 10 mL cultures of LB media containing 100 Pg/mL ampicillin. Expression was induced by the addition of 0.4 
mM isopropylthio-β-D-galactosidase (IPTG). The cells were subsequently pelleted and lysed by suspension in 500 PL 
of BUG BUSTER™ solution (Novagen, Inc., Madison, Wisconsin). The lysates were centrifuged and the supernatant 
was used for hydrogen exchange experiments without any further manipulation. SDS-PAGE indicated that the crude 
samples consisted of ~30%-40% expressed protein in a background of cellular impurities. The exact protein concentration 
in the crude extracts was determined by gel densitometry using pure samples of B1 domain (Q32C), purified as previously 
described (Sloan &amp; Hellinga, (1999) Protein Sci. 8: 1643-48), for calibration. 

2.B. Binding Analysis by Hydrogen Exchange 

[0239] The crude extracts of B1 domain were mixed with pure, proteolytically prepared Fc fragments of goat IgG 
(Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, Pennsylvania) to obtain the desired concentrations of the two components. 
The mixture was allowed to equilibrate for one hour on ice. Hydrogen exchange was initiated by adding 10-fold excess 
deuterated exchange buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 20 mM sodium acetate, 100 mM NaCl, pH 6.0) to the mixture. 
The exchange buffers contained different concentrations of deuterated guanidinium chloride (GdmCl). At a given ex-
change time, 1 Pl of the exchange reaction was added to 50 Pl of matrix solution. The matrix used for these experiments 
was sinapinic acid. It was prepared as a saturated solution in 45% acetonitrile 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid (pH 3.0) and 
was kept on ice (2 °C) prior to the addition of the protein. In order to obtain accurate mass measurements, a reference 
protein (λ 6-85 (Huang &amp; Oas, 1995)) was added to the matrix solution. Once the sample protein was added to the matrix, 
2 Pl of the solution was immediately placed on a MALDI target and rapidly dried under an air stream. Typically, the 
samples were placed in the matrix and dried within 1 minute. Mass spectra were collected on a VOYAGER® Biospec-
trometry Workstation from PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc., of Framingham, Massachusetts, using the autosampler mode. 
All spectra were obtained in the positive ion mode and summed over 32 laser shots. For a given data point, 30 MALDI 
spectra were analyzed and the results were averaged. No more than 10 minutes passed between matrix formation and 
data collection. 

2.C. Data Analysis 

[0240] According to the classical hydrogen exchange model (Hvidt &amp; Nielson, (1966) Adv. Protein Chem. 21: 287-386): 


EP 1 307 736 B1

where k ex is the observed exchange rate for each hydrogen, k open and k close are the rate constants for the conformational 
changes leading to exchange competent and exchange incompetent states respectively and k int is the exchange rate 
for the unprotected hydrogen. Under EX2 conditions where k close (or k open ) are much greater than k int : 

where K open is the equilibrium constant between the exchange competent and exchange incompetent conformations of 
the protein (k open /k close ). For the hydrogens that are exchanging through a global unfolding mechanism, 

Where K unfold is the global unfolding equilibrium constant. Substituting (3) into (2): 

Since k int is similar among the majority of the backbone amide hydrogens (Bai et al., (1993) Proteins 17: 75-86), the 
total exchange of the hydrogens that exchange through global unfolding can be estimated by a single rate constant. The 
increase in mass due to the exchange of globally exchanging protons as a function of time can thus be estimated by 
the following first order rate equation: 

M deut is the mass of the fully deuterated protein, A is the amplitude of the mass increase, t is the exchange time. The 
change in mass can be normalized to obtain fraction exchanged (FE): 

Where M prot is the mass of the fully protonated protein. Equation (12) can be transformed to: 

where A FE is the fraction of the protein that remains unexchanged. Substitution of Equation (4) into Equation (14) gives 
an equation for FE vs. denaturant concentration: 

where (Pace, (1986) Method Enzymol. 131: 266-80): 

is the free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant, R is the gas constant and T is the temperature 

in Kelvin. The global stabilities were determined by fitting FE vs. [denaturant] plots to Equation (15). The m value 
determines the sharpness of the transition in the FE vs. [denaturant] plot. Myers et al. have shown that m values can 
be estimated from the size of the protein (Myers et al., (1995) Protein Sci. 4: 2138-48). According to their analysis, B1

domain is predicted to have an m value of 1.6 0.4 kcal mol -1 M -1 . 
[0241] The stability of a protein in the event of single site substrate binding is (Schellman, (1975) Biopolymers 14: 
999-1018; Pace &amp; McGrath, (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255: 3862-65): 

where ∆G 0 
unfold(unbound) and ∆G 0 
unfold(bound) are the folding free energies in the absence and presence of substrate, 
S free is the concentration of unbound substrate in the solution and K d is the dissociation constant for binding. In some 
of the experiments conducted, the concentration of the substrate (Fc fragment) was not in great excess of the B1 domain. 
Therefore, depletion of substrate was taken into consideration (Segel, (1975) Enzyme Kinetics, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New 
York, New York): 

where S total and E total are the total concentrations of the Fc fragment and B1 domain respectively. Combining equations 
(15) to (18) provides the relationship between FE, substrate concentration and the dissociation constant and was used 
to fit the binding curve in Figure 5. 
[0242] Figure 5 demonstrates that as additional ligand is added, the amount of H/D exchange decreases, due to 
stability imparted by ligand binding. This change in stability was detected using the MALDI MS-HX methods of the present 
invention. Specifically, the test protein in this experiment, the B1 domain of streptococcal protein G, is incubated with 
various concentrations of a ligand, the Fc fragment. It is seen that FE decreases as ligand is added, indicative of increased 
stability. Thus, Figure 5 shows the FE of B1 domain in the presence of 0.75 M GdmCl. As ligand is added, the extent of 
exchange decreases due to protein stabilization. The dissociation constant was determined by least square analysis of 
the binding curve as described in the materials and methods section. The measured binding constant, 500 nM, is close 
to the expected value. 
[0243] Figures 6A-6D depict the extent of H/D exchange in the B1 domain, occurring over three different time periods. 
These figures indicate that complete exchange occurs at 10 minutes. The sigmoidal shape of the curves again indicates 
a cooperative unfolding event. Data was acquired in the presence and absence of ligand (Fc fragment). 
[0244] Figure 7A is a bar graph summarizing a comparison of the FE of a series of B1 domain mutants acquired in 
the presence and absence of ligand (Fc fragment). Figure 7B summarizes the difference in FE between the two conditions. 
The various stability measurements acquired from the data of Figures 5, 6A-6D and 7 were quantitated using the 
equations and relationships disclosed herein. 

Laboratory Example 3 

SUPREX As A Tool For Measuring Protein Stabilities In Vivo 

[0245] The G46A/G48A thermostable variant of monomeric lambda repressor (λ 6-85 ) (Burton et al., (1996) J. Mol. Biol. 
263: 311-22) was over-expressed using a T7 vector in E. coli in H 2 O-based media. To initiate hydrogen exchange, the 
bacteria were transferred to a deuterated media. Time-course studies indicated that under these conditions the D 2 O 
freely diffuses across the cell membrane and the solvent deuterons exchange with labile protons of the protein within 
the cytoplasm of the cell. Chloramphenicol was added to the deuterated media in order to inhibit further protein synthesis 
during the course of the exchange reaction, thereby preventing deuteration during synthesis. The E. coli cells were then 
lysed and the extent of exchange determined using MALDI mass spectrometry to measure the increase in mass, as 
generally depicted in the schematic of Figure 8. 

3.A. Sample Preparation 

[0246] In vivo experiments were conducted as depicted schematically in Figure 8. Specifically, for the in vitro exper-
iments, 1 ml cell cultures were pelleted and lysed in 50 Pl LB media containing 1X BUG BUSTER™ (Novagen, Madison, 
Wisconsin). The lysed cultures were centrifuged and 2 Pl of the supernatant was mixed with 18 Pl of the deuterated LB 
media to initiate exchange. After exchange for 20 minutes, 0.5 ml of the solution was mixed with 50 Pl of the matrix

solution and the MALDI was performed as described in Figure 8. Because there was more residual H 2 O during the in 
vitro exchange reaction, the effective mass of the fully deuterated protein (determined by conducting exchange at 37 
°C for 1 hr) was lower than the in vivo experiments. For the exchange experiment conducted in hyperosmotic media, 
the cells were grown and induced in normal LB, pelleted and resuspended in LB media containing 1.2 M NaCl. The 
bacteria were allowed to equilibrate for 2 hours before pelleting and resuspending in the deuterated media that also 
contained 1.2 M NaCl. 

3.B. The Protocol for Stability Measurements in Vivo 

[0247] The gene encoding the protein of interest was cloned into a T7 expression vector and transformed into E. coli 
strain BL21 (DE3). The cultures were grown in LB media and induced by 0.4 mM isopropylthio-B-D-galactosidase for 2 
hours at 37 °C. 100 Pl volumes of the cultures were then centrifuged and the media was removed. Deuterated LB media 
was made by dissolving the tryptone, yeast extract and NaCl in 99% D 2 O (Cambride Isotopes of Andover, Massachusetts) 
and 100 Pl volumes were used to resuspend the cell pellet and initiate exchange. The D 2 O is freely permeable across 
the membrane and enters the cytoplasm where H/D exchange of the protein occurs. The exchange buffer also contained 
10 Pg/ml chloramphenicol in order to inhibit protein synthesis during the course of the exchange reaction. The cultures 
were exchanged for given amounts of time and then immediately pelleted. The supernatant was removed and the cells 
were resuspended in . 500 PL of a saturated solution of sinapinic acid in 50% acetonitrile (matrix solution) that was kept 
at 2 °C. 2 PL of the samples were then rapidly dried on a MALDI target and the mass was analyzed using a VOYAGER® 
Biospectrometry Workstation from Perseptive Biosystems (Framingham, Massachusetts) by averaging 30 spectra in 
autosampler mode. A standard protein (lysozyme) was placed in the matrix solution and all the mass measurements 
were internally calibrated. 

3.C. Time Dependence of Amide Hydrogen Exchange in Vivo 

[0248] The mass of λ 6-85 versus H/D exchange time in vivo was determined at temperatures 15°C (represented by 
open diamonds in Figure 9), room temperature (represented by closed circles in Figure 9), and 37 °C (represented by 
open squares in Figure 9). The exchange was conducted in LB media at pH 7. The mass at time t=0 was determined 
by measuring the mass in an all-protonated media. The dashed line in Figure 9C shows the effective mass of the fully 
exchanged protein. The left y-axis of Figure 9 shows the measured mass and the right y-axis shows the calculated 
fraction exchanged. 

3.D. Stability of λ* 6-85 and Viability of E. Coli Cultures as a Function of Urea Concentration 

[0249] Figures 10A-10C depict a conventional denaturation curve by CD with purified protein in 0.15 M NaCl, 20 mM 
Na 2 HPO 4 , 20 mM CH 3 COONa, pH 8. The curve represents the best fit of the data using the linear extrapolation method 
(Pace, 1986), yielding a stability of 6.16+-0.13 kcal/mol. 
[0250] Figure 10B shows the viability of E.coli when placed in various concentrations of urea for 30 minutes at 23 
°C 
(closed circles) and 15 °C (open circles). 1 ml cultures of BL21-(DE3) E. coli were pelleted and resuspended in LB media 
containing various urea concentrations and incubated for 30 minutes at 15 °C and 23 °C. The cells were then pelleted 
and resuspended in 1 ml of LB media, diluted 1000, plated on LB-agar plates, incubated at 37 °C overnight and the 
number of colonies were counted. 
[0251] Figure 10C shows SUPREX data for λ* 6-85 at 15 °C in: (•) cell lysates at pH 8; (♦) cytoplasm of viable E. coli 
cells grown in normal LB media; and (P) SUPREX of viable E. coli cells equilibrated in hyperosmotic (1.2 M NaCl) LB 
media: The circle (•) and diamond (♦) curves represent the best fits of the data to Eq. 1 &amp; 2, yielding stabilities of 6.7+-
0.13 and 6.7+-0.2 kcal/mol in lysates and cells, respectively. 
[0252] The difference in the midpoints of the SUPREX and CD curves results from the ability of SUPREX to detect 
small populations of denatured protein and is not indicative of a large stability change.

High Sensitivity Measurements of Protein Stability by H/D Exchange and Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/ Ionization 
(MALDI) Mass Spectrometry 

4.A. Reagents 

[0253] Deuterium oxide (99.9 atom %D), sodium deuteroxide, and deuterium chloride were purchased from Aldrich 
(St. Loius, Missouri). Deuterated phosphoric acid was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, Mas-


EP 1 307 736 B1

5 





















sachusetts), and GdmCl (OMNIPUR™) was from EM Science. Bovine ubiquitin, hen egg lysozyme, and bovine pancreatic 
ribonuclease A (type I-A) were from Sigma (St. Louis, Missouri). Sinapinic acid (SA) was from Acros Organics. Trifluor-
oacetic acid (TFA) was obtained from Halocarbon (North Augusta, South Carolina), and acetonitrile (MeCN) and methanol 
(MeOH) were from Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). 

4.B. General Methods and Instrumentation 

[0254] MALDI mass spectra were acquired on a VOYAGER® DE Biospectrometry Workstation (PerSeptive Biosys-
tems, Inc., Framingham, Massachusetts) in the linear mode using a nitrogen laser (337 nm). SUPREX samples were 
prepared for MALDI analysis as described below. All mass spectra were collected in the positive-ion mode using an 
acceleration voltage of 25 kV, a grid voltage of 23 kV, a guide wire voltage of 75 V, and a delay time of 225 ns. Each 
spectrum obtained was the sum of either 16 or 32 laser shots. The raw intensity versus time data in each mass spectrum 
was smoothed using a Savitsky-Golay smoothing routine prior to mass calibration using internal standards. 
[0255] Fluorescence measurements were made on a Fluorolog-3 manufactured by Jobin Yvon-SPEX (Jobin Yvon 
Ltd., Middlesex, England) using a quartz cuvette (10 10 mm) and using excitation and emission slit widths of 4 and 
8 mm, respectively. The excitation wavelength was set at 278 nm and the emission wavelength was scanned from 250 
to 400 nm in 0.2 nm steps with a 500 ms dwell time. 
[0256] RNase A protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient 
of 9800 M -1 cm -1 at 278 nm (Sela &amp; Anfinsen, (1957) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 24: 229-235). UV/Vis absorbance data 
were collected using a Hewlett Packard 8452A Diode Array UV/Vis Spectrophotometer (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, 
California). All GdmCl concentrations were determined using a Bausch &amp; Lomb (Rochester, New York) refractometer 
by the method of Nozaki (Nozaki, (1972) Methods Enzymol., 26: 43-50). All pH measurements were recorded using a 
Jenco 6072 pH meter equipped with a Futura™ calomel pH electrode from Beckman Instruments (Fullerton, California). 
Buffer pD values were determined from pH measurements by adding 0.4 to the measured pH according to Glascoe &amp; 
Long (Glascoe &amp; Long, (1959) Anal. Chem. 64: 188-190). 

4.C. SUPREX Data Collection and Analysis 

[0257] Two different experimental protocols were employed for the SUPREX analysis of RNase A including one for 
normal analyses and one for high sensitivity analyses. H/D exchange reactions were initiated by combining 1PL aliquots 
of a 100 PM solution of RNase A (fully protonated) in 20mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH = 7.4) with 9PL volumes of 
10 different deuterated exchange buffers containing 20 mM sodium phosphate (pD = 7.4) and concentrations of GdmCl 
that varied between 0.5 and 4 M. After a specified exchange time (typically 65 minutes), a 1PL aliquot of each exchange 
reaction was combined with 19 PL of a MALDI matrix solution. The MALDI matrix solution, which comprised an ice-cold, 
saturated, aqueous solution of SA containing 63% MeCN and 0.1 % TFA (pH = 3.0), effectively quenched the H/D 
exchange reaction and prepared the sample for MALDI analysis. This matrix solution also included two internal mass 
standards, bovine ubiquitin (8566.1 Da) and hen egg lysozyme (14,303.7 Da). Subsequently, 1 PL of the quenched 
exchange reaction was spotted on a stainless steel MALDI plate and the solvent was evaporated under a gentle flow of 
air. Solvent evaporation was typically complete within one minute. 
[0258] High sensitivity SUPREX analyses of RNase A were performed according to the experimental protocol shown 
in Figure 11. The high sensitivity SUPREX protocol outlined in Figure 11 is similar to the SUPREX protocol disclosed 
above, with the exception that protein samples were subjected to a micro-concentration step after H/D exchange and 
prior to MALDI analysis. This micro-concentration step involved the use of a batch chromatography method utilizing 10 
PL C 18 SUPROTIPS™ from AmiKa (Columbia, Maryland). It was preferred to quench the H/D exchange reaction with 
TFA (0.25 % v/v) prior to binding the deuterated protein samples to the SUPROTIPS™. This facilitated preservation of 
the deuteration state of the protein. Binding of RNase A to the tip was achieved after five cycles of pipetting a 2 PL 
aliquot into the tip, waiting five seconds, and expelling the aliquot to waste. The tip was rinsed with a 2 PL aliquot of an 
ice-cold, aqueous solution containing 5% MeOH and 0.1 %TFA in order to wash away excess GdmCl. Finally, RNase 
A was eluted from the reversed-phase coating in the SUPROTIPS™ and directly onto a MALDI sample stage using 
approximately 1 Pl of the ice-cold MALDI matrix solution described above. 
[0259] For both normal and high sensitivity analyses 10 replicate MALDI mass spectra were collected and analyzed 
to determine an average change in mass relative to the fully protonated sample (∆Mass) at each [GdmCl]. These spectra 
were generated by sampling different regions of a single MALDI sample preparation. Ultimately, ∆Mass values were 
plotted as a function of [GdmCI] and the data were fit to the SUPREX equation: 


EP 1 307 736 B1 

45 

5 





















where 

∆M 0 was ∆Mass before global exchange, ∆M ∞ was ∆Mass after complete exchange, t was the time of exchange, &lt;k int &gt; 

was the average intrinsic H/D exchange rate for an amide proton, ∆G f was the free energy of folding in the absence of 
GdmCl, [GdmCl] was the GdmCl concentration, m was δ∆G f / δ [GdmCl], R was the gas constant, and T was the temperature 
in Kelvin. 
[0260] Values for ∆M 0 , ∆M ∞ and ∆G f were obtained by fitting the ∆Mass versus [GdmCl] data to equation 1 using 
SigmaPlot and a nonlinear least squares analysis. &lt;k int &gt; value of 8.47 s -1 was used, which was calculated based on 
the data of Bai et al. (Bai et al., (1993) Proteins 17: 75-86), using the program SPHERE (Zhang, Ph.D. Thesis, Structural 
Biology and Molecular Biophysics, University of Pennsylvania); and an m value of 3.1 kcal mol -1 M -1 was used, which 
was previously determined in other GdmCl-induced equilibrium unfolding experiments on RNase A (Pace et al., (1990) 
Biochem. 29: 2564-72). The quantitative analysis of the SUPREX data in this Example assumed that RNase A unfolded 
in a cooperative, two-state process and that the protein was under EX2 exchange conditions (i.e. the unfolding and 
refolding rate of the protein is faster than the intrinsic rate of H/D exchange). Previous work on the RNase A system 
indicates that these assumptions are valid (Pace et al., (1990) Biochem. 29: 2564-72; Huyghues-Despointes et al., 
(1999) Nat. Struct. Biol. 6: 910-12.) 

4.D. Summary of Results 

[0261] Typical results from the normal SUPREX analysis of RNase A are shown in Figures 12A and 12B. The MALDI 
mass spectrum in Figure 12A is typical in quality (i.e. signal intensity and resolution) to those that were used to generate 
the SUPREX curve shown in Figure 12B. Thus, Figure 12A is a representative MALDI mass spectrum acquired in the 
normal SUPREX analysis of RNase A. The ion signal detected for RNase A at m/z 13,732.6 indicates a mass gain of 
49.5 over the fully protonated molecule. The resolution, full width half maximum (FWHM), for the RNase A and calibrant 
peaks were 375 and 587, respectively. The peaks labeled with a * are attributed to impurities in the sample. 
[0262] The SUPREX curve in Figure 12B yielded a ∆G f value for RNase A of -12.9 kcal mol -1 with a standard error of 
0.2 kcal mol -1 . Figure 12B is a typical SUPREX curve obtained for RNase A using a normal SUPREX protocol. The 
average ∆G f value and standard deviation that was obtained from threereplicate SUPREX analyses of RNase A was 
-12.4 0.4 kcal mol -1 . The ∆G f value for RNase A that was determined by SUPREX is in relatively good agreement 
with the ∆G f value of -9.24 0.64 kcal mol -1 that was determined by Pace et. al. using conventional fluorescence 
denaturation methods (Pace et al., (1986) 131: 266-280). The difference between the two measurements is likely due 
to inherent difficulties with SUPREX that are associated with obtaining an accurate measure of &lt;k int &gt;. The &lt;k int &gt; value 
that was utilized in the SUPREX analysis of RNase Awas based on model peptide studies (Bai et al., (1993) Proteins 
17: 75-86). 
[0263] The protocol includes a batch chromatography step for the micro-concentration and desalting of protein samples 
after H/D exchange and prior to MALDI analysis. In the development of the protocol in Figure 11 it was observed that it 
was preferable to quench the H/D exchange reactions with TFA (0.25 % v/v) prior to subjecting them to a batch chro-
matography step using reversed-phase C 18 media. Figure 13 represents SUPREX data obtained for RNase A using a 
high sensitivity SUPREX protocol that did not include a step quenching the H/D exchange reactions with TFA (0.25 % 
v/v) prior to subjecting them to a batch chromatography step for micro-concentration. 
[0264] Shown in Figure 12B are the SUPREX data obtained on RNase A using the high sensitivity protocol outlined 
in Figure 11. The MALDI mass spectrum in Figure 12A is typical in quality (i.e. signal intensity and resolution) to those 
that was used to generate the SUPREX curve shown in Figure 12B. Analysis of the SUPREX data in Figure 12B yielded 
a ∆G f value for RNase A of -12.4 kcal mol -1 with a standard error of 0.2 kcal mol -1 . The average ∆G f value and standard 
deviation that was obtained from 3 replicate SUPREX analyses of RNase A using the high sensitivity SUPREX protocol 
was -12.0 0.5 kcal mol -1 . This ∆G f value for RNase A is in very close agreement with the ∆G f value of -12.4 0.4 
kcal mol -1 that was determined using the normal SUPREX protocol described above. 
[0265] Figure 14A is a representative MALDI mass spectrum acquired in the high sensitivity SUPREX analysis of 
RNase A. The ion signal detected for RNase A at m/z 13,757.2 indicates a mass gain of 74.1 Da over the fully protonated 
molecule. The resolution, full width half maximum (FWHM), for the RNase A and calibrant peaks were 327 and 472, 
respectively. The peaks labeled with a * are attributed to impurities in the sample. In Figure 14B, a typical SUPREX data 
obtained for RNase A using the high sensitivity SUPREX protocol in Figure 11 is presented. The data in Figures 14A 
and 14B were generated using a total of 10 pmol of RNase A (i.e. 10 Pl of a 1 PM solution). This amount of material is 
100-fold less than that required in the normal SUPREX protocol. It is also several orders less material than that required

by conventional spectroscopy-based methods. The SUPREX curve in Figure 14B was generated using only 10 pmol of 
RNase A. 

Laboratory Example 5 

SUPREX Analysis of Multimeric Proteins 

[0266] Referring to Figure 15, results from the SUPREX analysis of P22 Arc repressor, a homo-dimeric protein, are 
shown. The line represents the best fit of the data to the SUPREX equation (i.e. Equation (6)). As expected for a multimeric 
protein, the measured ∆G value increased with increasing protein concentration. If the ∆G SUPREX values recorded at 
each protein concentration are adjusted to standard conditions (1 M dimer) then the data at each protein concentration 
yields a standard ∆G value of 11.3 0.2 kcal/mol which is consistant with the previously reported value of 11.0 kcal/mol 
that was obtained in conventional CD denaturation studies (Bowie et al., (1989) Biochemistry 28: 7139-7143). 

Laboratory Example 6 

[0267] Figure 16 depicts the results of a SUPREX analysis of bovine serum albumin, a high molecular weight protein. 
The line represents the best fit of the data to the SUPREX equation (i.e. Equation (6)) when m = 15 kcal/mol M and k int = 
52.7 sec -1 . 

Laboratory Example 7 

[0268] Figures 17A and 17B depict the results of a SUPREX analysis of P22 Arc repressor in the absence (Figure 
17A) and the presence (Figure 17B) of cognate DNA. The data was generated using an Arc dimer concentration of 12 
PM in deuterated exchange buffers containing 20 mM phosphate (pH = 7.4) and varying concentrations of GdmCl. At 
this concentration the stability of the Arc dimer is less than that detectable by SUPREX. Even with exchange times of 
several minutes, there is no transition detected in the SUPREX curve. The transition midpoint is shifted off scale to the 
left; and only a maximum ∆G SUPREX value (&lt; 4.0 kcal/mol) can be calculated. The addition of Arc repressor's cognate 
DNA (a double stranded 27mer of sequence ATC GAT GAT AGA AGC ACT CTA CTA TCG (SEQ ID NO: 1) to the 
exchange buffer significantly stabilized the Arc dimer to the point that the its stability could be measured by SUPREX. 
The addition of 6.3 PM DNA to the exchange buffer resulted in an apparent stabilization, ∆G Binding , of at least 1.4 kcal/mol. 

Laboratory Example 8 

[0269] Figures 18A and 18B depict the results of a SUPREX analysis of the Trp repressor protein in the absence 
(Figure 18A) and the presence (Figure 18B) of a tight binding ligand, L-tryptophan. A fit of each data set to the SUPREX 
equation yielded folding free energies of -23.4 0.1 and -27.2 0.1 kcal/mol for the Trp repressor protein in the absence 
and presence of L-tryptophan, respectively. The concentration of Trp repressor in these experiments was 20 PM; and 
in (B) the concentration of L-tryptophan in each SUPREX buffer was 200 PM. At these concentrations of protein and 
ligand the data indicate that the ∆G Binding for the Trp repressor and L-tryptophan system is -3.8 kcal/mol. 

Laboratory Example 9 

[0270] Figure 19 depicts a SUPREX analysis of the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) protease in the absence 
(circles) and presence (triangles) of the tight binding inhibitor, TL-3. A fit of each data set to the SUPREX equation 
yielded folding free energies of -13.0 0.3 and -15.2 0.2 kcal/mol for the FIV protease in the absence and presence 
of the TL-3 inhibitor, respectively. The concentration of the FIV protease in these experiments was 8 PM; and in (B) the 
concentration of the TL-3 inhibitor in each SUPREX buffer was 100 PM. At these concentrations of protein and ligand 
the data indicate that the ∆G Binding for the this enzyme-inhibitor system is -2.2 kcal/mol. 

Laboratory Example 10 

[0271] Figure 20 depicts a SUPREX analysis of ferric hemoglobin (squares) and ferrous hemoglobin (circles) in the 
presence of cyanide ion. The lines represent the best fit of each data set to the SUPREX equation (i.e. Equation (6)). 
In this analysis of the data k int was set at 4.2 sec -1 , t = 65 min -1 , and all other parameters in the SUPREX equation (i.e. 
∆M 0 , ∆M ∞ , and ∆G f , and m) were allowed to float. In this case an m-value of 1.1 kcal/mol was obtained. This m-value 

is significantly smaller than would be predicted for hemoglobin if it unfolded in a two-state process (i.e. 4.0 kcal mol -1 
M -1 ). The relatively small m-value that was recorded for hemoglobin in the SUPREX experiment is consistent with a 


EP 1 307 736 B1 

47 

5 





















multi-state unfolding mechanism for this protein. Such multi-state unfolding behavior for hemoglobin's protein folding 
reaction has been previously noted. Thus, a meaningful folding free energy cannot be extracted from the SUPREX 
analysis of hemoglobin. However, it is noteworthy that a measurable shift (approximately 0.5 M) in the SUPREX transition 
midpoint to a higher [GdmCl] concentration is detected for the ferric hemoglobin SUPREX curve recorded in the presence 
of cyanide ion. This shift in the transition midpoint for ferric hemoglobin in the presence of cyanide is consistent with the 
tight binding interaction (affinity constant 100 nM -1 ) of this ligand with hemoglobin.

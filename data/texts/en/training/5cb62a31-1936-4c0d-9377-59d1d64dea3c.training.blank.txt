Nanostructured composite dispersions containing magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and graphene oxide (GO) lamellae have been 
prepared by a simple and easily scalable room temperature procedure. We show that, owing to the enormous surface area and 
negative surface charge developed in aqueous GO suspensions, large amounts of positively charged MNPs can be electrostatically 
attached to the layered host. is procedure is superior to many previous synthesis pathways because it exploits the charge-
regulated adhesion of naked MNPs to GO resulting in the formation of stable and uniform nanocomposite materials in a wide 
composition range without any preliminary functionalization steps or harsh conditions that may lead to chemical degradation of 
the graphene-based nanosheets. 

1. Introduction 

Functional magnetic nanocomposites have been the focus of 
recent research due to their envisioned applications in 
biomedical, pharmaceutical, environmental, or nano-
electronic fields [1-5]. e most efficient use of these systems 
inevitably requires the precise control over their chemical 
and nanostructure. 
e elaboration of fast, efficient, and 
easily scalable methods is then pursued, which enables to 
obtain tailor-made synthesis solutions for specific applica-
tions. With the advent of graphene in emerging technolo-
gies, many studies have been published in the recent few 
years about the preparation and characterization of mag-
netically modified graphene-based materials. Graphene 
oxide (GO) is the most prominent host of magnetic 
nanoparticle (MNP) composites because its properties make 
it advantageous for large-scale production. Owing to their 
polar and ionisable surface sites [6], GO particles and their 
functionalized derivatives [7, 8] are easily processable in 

aqueous media, which favors the interaction of the lamellar 
host with the simplest, water-soluble iron salts (e.g., FeSO 4 
or FeCl 3 ) and complexes as precursors [9-12]. Graphene-
based composites are then obtained by transformation of 
GO to reduced graphene oxide (RGO). Extensive literature 
survey reveals three general synthesis routes for the for-
mation of magnetic graphene particles: hydrothermal (more 
broadly and solvothermal) approaches [13-21], direct py-
rolysis [9, 11, 22], and coprecipitation [23-30], all of which 
rely on in situ crystallization of MNPs on the carbonaceous 
layers and usually lead to the simultaneous reduction of 
GO to RGO. 
However, some potential applications (e.g., drug delivery 
[31, 32]) strongly demand that the oxidized form of the 
carbon counterpart of the magnetic composite remains 
unaltered after the composite formation. Although the 
coprecipitation [33, 34] and chemical grafting [35, 36] 
methods have been used under relatively mild conditions 
(∼80 °C reaction temperature), the presence of bases at

elevated temperatures inevitably results in partial de-
oxygenation of the GO framework [37, 38]. Another, more 
viable strategy is the preliminary functionalization of the 
magnetite nanoparticles [39], sulfonation of graphene oxide 
[40], or derivatization of both constituents by coupling 
azide-modified MNPs with alkyne-functionalized GO as 
reported by Namvari and Namazi [41]. e drawback of such 
routes is that they often require more tedious and com-
plicated operations. 
us, it is still desirable to develop 
a more facile and efficient method for the preparation of 
magnetically modified GO materials. 
In the present work, we report on a one-pot scalable 
method for the combination of magnetic nanoparticles with 
graphene oxide nanosheets exploiting the electrostatic in-
teraction between their colloidal particles in aqueous so-
lutions as provided by the development of their opposite 
surface charge. e structural and colloidal characteristics of 
the single and nanocomposite dispersions are characterized 
in detail. Up to now, to the best of our knowledge, there have 
been no other reports on the stable and strong attachment of 
Fe 3 O 4 to graphene oxide in the absence of any function-
alization scheme involved in the synthesis process. 

2. Materials and Methods 

2.1. Materials. For the synthesis of graphite oxide, we used 
purified (99.9 wt.% C) graphite flakes of natural origin 
(codenamed as SGA-20) purchased from Kropfmühl 
GmbH, Germany. 
e samples were also fractionated by 
the manufacturer (d 90 &lt; 50 µm, d 50 � 16-21 µm). NaNO 3 , 
KMnO 4 , the iron precursor salts, concentrated sulfuric acid, 
and 30 wt.% hydrogen peroxide solutions were purchased 
from Molar Chemicals Ltd., Hungary. NaCl, NaOH, and 
HCl solutions used for maintaining constant background 
salt concentrations and constant pHs were used in analytical 
purity (Reanal). Water was deionised by ion exchange only 
for dialysis, while it was deionised by reverse osmosis and 
purified from particulate contaminants for all of the syn-
theses and light-scattering studies by Zeneer Power (TOC)-
RO&amp;UP System. 

2.2. Synthesis of Graphite Oxide by Hummers-Offeman 
Method. A round-bottom flask was filled with 1 g of 
graphite and 1 g of NaNO 3 , which have been mixed together 
before 30 mL of cc. H 2 SO 4 was added. e suspension was 
stirred continuously with a magnetic stirrer, and 3 × 1 g of 
KMnO 4 was added in three portions hour by hour, upon 
which the thick slurry turned to green and became more 
viscous due to the swelling of the graphite structure and the 
formation of graphite bisulphate. It was then heated to 52 ± 
3 °C and kept at this temperature for 6 hours. e oxidation 
reaction was terminated by the slow addition of 30 mL water 
close to 0 °C, and then H 2 O 2 solution (∼2 mL) was gradually 
added until the suspension turned to golden brown and the 
effervescence discontinued. 
e as-obtained acidic slurry 
was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3400 rpm 3-4 times with 
intermittent removal of the supernatant and redispersion of 
the settled GO particles. During the successive increase of 

the pH of the dispersion medium, GO particles became 
colloidally stable, and centrifugation was incapable to re-
move them from the liquid phase. erefore, the wet sed-
iment was transferred to dialysis bags and dialyzed for ca. 
10 days with periodic change of deionized water until its 
conductivity was steadily below 10 µS/cm. GO was stored in 
aqueous suspension form, the concentration of which was 
determined by evaporating a known mass of dispersion to 
air-dry state. 

2.3. Synthesis of MNPs. Magnetite nanoparticles were syn-
thesized by alkaline hydrolysis [42-44] of FeCl 2 × 4 H 2 O and 
FeCl 3 × 6 H 2 O. e concentrated solutions of iron (II) and 
iron (III) salts were mixed in the molar ratio of 1.1 to 2 
and filtered into fresh water using a microfilter of 0.2 µm 
pore size. e calculated amount of freshly prepared NaOH 
solution was added in 10% excess to the doubly diluted iron 
salt solution in two portions, the first half slowly and the 
second half rapidly under rigorous stirring. 
e formed 
black suspension was stirred for few minutes and then 
transferred into a larger amount of water. e suspension 
was washed with water several times to eliminate the alkaline 
impurities from synthesis, then acidified with HCl solution 
down to pH∼2, and washed again with water until disaggre-
gation. e next step was the hydrothermal ageing of stable 
suspension in an ultrasonic bath at 80 °C for 30 minutes. Finally, 
it was dialyzed against 0.001 M HCl. e magnetite concen-
tration was determined gravimetrically from a sample dried at 
105 °C. e stock suspension (5.78 g magnetite in 100 g 0.001 M 
HCl) was stored in the dark at 4 °C. 

2.4. Preparation of GO/MNP Nanocomposites. 10 g/L aque-
ous suspensions of the magnetic iron oxide and the graphite 
oxide phases directly diluted from the respective stock 
dispersions were used for the formation of composite ma-
terials. ey were sonicated for 30 s before rapidly mixing 
them in appropriate volumes and, if necessary, adding water 
so that the total concentration of magnetite was 5 g/L. e 
concentration of GO was varied so that composite samples 
within the GO/MNP weight ratio range of 1/50 to 10/1 were 
obtained and stored in liquid-dispersed state for further 
studies. 
e final pH of suspensions were within the 
pH � 4.5-6 range. 

2.5. Characterization. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was 
performed by a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer equipped 
with a Göbel mirror to yield a parallel beam of CuKα ra-
diation, which passed through a 1.2 mm slit. e X-ray tube 
was operated with 40 kV acceleration voltage at 30 mA 
current. e diffraction data were collected with a count time 
of 1 s per step and sampling width of 0.02 

°. 

FTIR measurements were conducted in attenuated total 
reflection (ATR) mode using a Bio-Rad Digilab Division 
FTS-65A/896 instrument equipped with a single reflection 
ATR accessory made of diamond and a DTGS detector. 128 
scans were collected and averaged to obtain the spectra in 
2 cm −1 digital resolution.

Raman spectra were collected on a 

ermo Scienti c 
DXR Raman microscope equipped with a diode-pumped 
frequency-doubled Nd-YAG laser. Samples were irradiated 
at a wavelength of 532.2 nm, with the laser beam focused 
using a 20× objective lens. 1 mW laser power was used to 
record the spectra. e instrument had a spectral resolution 
better than 2 cm −1 and a spatial resolution of a few cubic 
micrometers as provided by a 50 μm slit confocal aperture. 
TEM micrographs were taken by a JEOL JEM-1400+ 
transmission electron microscope operating at an acceler-
ating voltage of 80 kV. One droplet of diluted nano-
composite dispersion was dried onto a carbon lm-coated 
copper grid. 
Dynamic light scattering measurements were taken by a 
NanoZS apparatus (Malvern) equipped with a 4 mW He-Ne 
laser source (λ 633 nm). e scattered light intensity was 
measured at an angle of 173 °. e same instrument enabled 
for the measurement of the electrokinetic potential of the 
composite particles that were determined in the same dis-
persions as used for size measurements but using disposable 
zeta cells (DTS 1070) instead of plastic cuvettes. Composite 
samples were measured in highly diluted suspension to avoid 
signi cant interparticle interactions (hydrodynamic interaction 
or multiple light scattering). 
A superconducting quantum interference device 
(SQUID) magnetometer (MPMS XL-7 type, Quantum 
Design, U.S.A.) was employed for the magnetization mea-
surement at 300 K. e hysteresis loop of the naked MNP 
sample was measured in an external magnetic eld ranging 
from −50 to +50 kOe. e magnetization values were cor-
rected assuming the response of the sample holder and 
respective Pascal constants. 
Magnetic uid hyperthermia measurements were carried 

out by a magne erm ™ (Nanotherics, UK) system [45, 46]. 

e magnetic material content of each sample (bare MNP 
and nanocomposites at 1/50 and 1/5 mass ratios) was the 
same for all samples (5 g/L). After ultrasonication of 1 mL of 
each sample for 20 s, the heating e ciency was measured at 
a resonant frequency of 109.4 kHz with magnetic eld of 
B 24.67 mT (H 19.9 kA/m, 17 turn coil, and 200 nF ca-
pacitor) for 300 s. SAR (speci c absorption rate) values were 
not calculated from the initial slope of heating curves be-
cause their initial slopes were unusual for the nano-
composites and they di er from that of the naked MNP 
sample probably due to their aggregation. 

3. Results and Discussion 

3.1. Properties of Graphite Oxide. Figure 1 shows the XRD 
patterns of graphite before and after its harsh oxidation 
treatment. Graphite powder shows an outstandingly intense 
re ection centered at the di raction angle of 26.6 °. e re-
spective c-axis repeat distance is 3.35 Å, which represents the 
spacing between graphene layers in well-crystallized graphite 
grains. is (002) re ection is shifted towards much lower 
angle values, the position of which was found to vary with 
ambient humidity conditions. 
e typical pattern of GO 
features two bands, one centered at 11 °, while for the secondary 
one appearing with much lower intensity, the di raction angle 

is doubled. e two peaks refer to the same periodic distance 
of 8.04 Å, indicating that the crystal structure of graphite 
expands to accommodate oxygenated functional groups and 
water molecules. Noteworthy is the broadening of the GO 
re ection as compared to graphite, which may be either 
caused by the nonuniform loading and distribution of water 
molecules between the graphene oxide sheets or by a decrease 
in the average ake size of graphite particles in the direction 
perpendicular to the carbon planes upon oxidation. 
Raman spectroscopy is reported as a noninvasive tool to 
characterize the degree of oxidation and structure of 
graphene-based materials. 
e upper side spectrum of 
Figure 2 shows the Raman spectrum with well-resolved 
peaks characteristic for the graphite structure. 
e most 
intense and the sharpest one is the so-called G-band, which 
is the primary mode in many carbon materials representing 
the planar con guration of sp 2 hybridized bonds that hold 
together the largest part of the atomic framework of the 
stacked graphene sheets. It appears at 1582 cm −1 , which is 
identical to the respective wavenumbers of the G-bands for 
various graphite samples (involving highly oriented pyro-
lytic graphite) commonly reported in the literature [47-50]. 
Another in-plane vibration mode that also appears for the 
present and, in general, all previously studies of graphite 
samples is the 2D band at 2722 cm −1 , which is a second-order 
overtone of the D-band centered at 1360 cm −1 . e latter, 
rst-order peak is not visible in perfect graphene owing to 
crystal symmetry considerations detailed in [47], in contrast 
to the parent graphite of our GO samples. e prerequisite of 
this band to appear is that defect or zone boundaries are 
abundant in the samples that enable a secondary elastic 
scattering of a phonon. Surprisingly, such defects are already

present to a relatively high extent in the pristine graphite. 
Since the manufacturer does not report any harsh pre-
treatment of the present samples, we think that the grains are 
composed of very polydisperse multilayer stacks and the 
nanolamellar fraction with edges constructed of sp 3 carbon 
atoms are present in relatively large proportion. e spec-
trum of graphite oxide (Figure 2(b)) proves that signi cant 
changes occurred by the oxidation of the carbon lattice. e 
most remarkable feature is the enhancement of disorder-
related bands. e D-band shows height equal to the pri-
mary in-plane vibrational mode, while a scattering peak 

(] 2954 cm −1 ) appears at the higher wavenumber side of 
the 2D band which is ascribed to the combination of D + G 
modes [51]. e last prominent feature for GO is that the 
G-band is blue shifted by 21 cm −1 to 1603 cm −1 . 
is is 
originally present as a high-energy shoulder in graphite (G′), 
but for highly disordered carbons such as GO, it refers to an 
abundance of sp 3 carbon atoms similar to that obtained 
upon physical (e.g., electron beam irradiation [52]) or 
chemical (strong oxidation) impacts. e inserted micro-
scopic images in Figure 2 con rm the strong structural 
transformation: multilayered akes of graphite are trans-
formed into a puckered thin lm state where the phase 
boundaries of individual, wrinkled particles are no longer 
observable. 
Changes in the ATR-FTIR spectra brought by the oxi-
dation reaction are indicated in Figure 3. In the most in-
formative spectral region, graphite exhibits a featureless 
spectrum indicating the absence of any functional groups. 
On the other hand, several bands are distinguishable in the 
spectrum of graphite oxide. 
e rst one appears at 
1734 cm −1 , and it is commonly assigned to the presence of 
functional groups containing the C O motif. Carbonyl 
groups have been mostly suggested as part of the COOH 
moiety, while other assignments include single ketones or 
quinones [53]. At 1625 cm −1 , the bending vibration of 
physically adsorbed water molecules gives rise to a peak. is 
is followed by a broad hump with several weak and poorly 
resolved bands emerging from the baseline. Only two of 
them can be associated with speci c oxygenated function-
alities: tertiary alcohol groups around 1400 cm −1 and phe-
nolic OH around 1200 cm −1 ; however, their exact positions 
cannot be exactly assessed. Finally, the spectrum of GO 
represents several peaks at the lowest wavenumbers origi-
nating from C-C and C-O lattice vibration modes.

3.2. Structural Properties of GO/MNP Nanocomposites. Figure 4 
shows the X-ray di ractograms of the magnetite nano-
composites loaded with di erent amounts of GO. Two re-
ections are distinguished in these samples (at 2Θ 30.36 

°and 

35.6 °) that belong to the (220) and (311) lattice planes of 
the cubic magnetite crystal structure [54]. Since the dom-
inant mass in all samples belongs to the MNP phase, the 
respective peak intensities do not show much variation with 
the composition. An average crystallite diameter was cal-
culated from the broadening of the (311) re ections, and they 
were found to be 10 nm and obviously did not change during 
composite formation. Although the apparent breadth of the 
(220) re ection is larger for the GO/MNP 1/5 composite, 
this is solely due to the irregular baseline that originates 
from the uorescence of the CuKα radiation on iron centers. 
e most interesting feature of the powder X-ray patterns is 
the complete disappearance of the re ection at low angles 
that is characteristic for the interplanar distance of graphite 
oxide particles. 
is clearly shows that the carbon-based 
phase is dispersed to the level of individual graphene oxide 
particles. It is known that high degrees of exfoliation are 
achieved in aqueous GO suspensions since many atomic 
force microscopic studies imaged 1 nm high platelets de-
posited from the liquid phase [55]. During composite for-
mation with the magnetic phase, the liquid-suspended GO 
nanosheets exhibit an enormously high speci c surface area 
available for the attachment of the MNPs. When the dis-
persion medium is dried o from the composite particles, 
the coated lamellae must be restacked and become rota-
tionally disordered but parallelly aligned to the sample 
holder, capturing iron oxide particles between the layers. 
Obviously, the repeat distances in the expanded layer 
structure are then too large to give any di raction peak in 
the studied angle range. However, it might be somewhat 

surprising that the GO peak is absent even at the highest 
GO/MNP ratios of 1/5, for which the number of sheets may 
exceed the necessary area needed to accommodate the 
magnetite nanoparticles, and restacked empty areas could 
still give rise to an interlayer distance similar to that found 
for bare GO. is phenomenon implies that the composite 
particles may retain a "house of cards" structure in the 
dried state with single-or few-layered GO particles present 
in the matrix of the aggregated mass of the magnetite 
nanoparticles. 
e ATR-FTIR spectrum of the nanocomposite of 
GO/MNP ratio of 1/10 is compared to that of the bare 
magnetite phase in Figure 3. e latter shows two peaks, one 
at 1620 cm −1 and another at 556 cm −1 with two minor 
shoulders appearing at around 630 and 700 cm −1 . e former 
is due to the bending vibration of adsorbed water, and the 
others are attributed to di erent vibration modes of the Fe-O 
structure [56]. 
e nanocomposite shows very weak ab-
sorption at wavenumbers characteristic for GO, and the iron 
oxide-related peaks dominate the spectrum. However, the 
most intense band shows a red shift by 23 cm −1 , indicating 
a slight weakening of the bond strength between Fe and O 
atoms. is might be caused by the extensive hydrogen bond 
network between the hydroxylated GO and Fe 3 O 4 surfaces, 
but it is also possible that there is an abundance of positively 
charged surface sites (≡Fe-OH 2 
+ ) developed on the iron oxide 
when it is contacted with GO. 
Electron microscopy revealed important di erences in 
the nanostructure of the GO/MNP composites at di erent 
compositions (Figure 5). At the lowest MNP loadings 
(GO/MNP mass ratio of 1/5), the majority of the primary 
magnetic nanocrystals are well-distinguishable and clus-
tering only occurs on a few locations of the GO surface, for 
example, near the top right corner of the image. With a few 
exceptions, the diameters of the particles fall into the range 
of 3-20 nm, which is typical for Fe 3 O 4 nanophases exhib-
iting superparamagnetic behavior. 
e average size was 
9.5 nm, showing good agreement with the one determined 
by XRD line broadening. Graphene oxide is also visualized 
on the micrographs at relatively high magni cations. In the 
current image and in others taken at di erent areas of the 
sample, they appear as slightly curved lines with approxi-
mate length of 50 nm, reminiscent of folded paper-like 
layers. ese features give conclusive proof that the exi-
ble particles are present in a highly delaminated, single-layer 
state, that otherwise do not give enough contrast for direct 
observation by TEM. Interestingly, a relatively large fraction 
of magnetite nanocrystals are attached to the graphene oxide 
platelets following the shape of these folds or along the 
platelet edges, suggesting that these surface features exert 
stronger adhesive forces towards the MNPs. Upon in-
creasing the MNP loading to tenfold excess relative to GO 
(Figure 5(b)), the surface coverage of particles increased 
proportionally. e planar distribution of particles did not 
change with loading: sites densely covered by magnetite were 
loosely interconnected, leaving behind irregularly shaped 
patches over the uncoated graphene oxide surfaces of several 
hundreds to thousands of square nanometer surface area. 
However, at the highest GO/MNP ratio (1/50), the particles

are almost fully covered, and the magnetic nanocrystals 
undergo signi cant clustering that is virtually extended to 
the whole imaged area. 
Due to the high MNP contents, signi cant variations 
might occur at the microscopic level in the particle-to-
particle compositions. Besides, once the available surface 
area becomes lower than that required for the deposition of 
the total amount of particles, the sample would lose phase 
homogeneity and become a mixture of a nanocomposite 
phase consisting of GO layers fully covered with the MNPs 
and a pure magnetite phase involving the rest of the MNPs. 
To check this possibility, TEM images were taken on the 
highly loaded samples at low magni cations, which were 
qualitatively similar to that presented in Figure 6. We 

observed that virtually all magnetic iron oxide particles were 
assembled only on the lamellar surfaces. 
is is another 
important nding because it indicates not only that MNPs 
are only dispersed on GO in the dry state but also that 
a stable nanocomposite phase was already present in the 
aqueous suspension. is latter statement is well established 
since it is highly unlikely that such a large amount of 
separated single or clustered nanocrystallites would have 
exclusively assembled on the GO platelet only because of the 
loss of the solvent. 

3.3. Characteristics of Magnetic Nanocomposite Dispersions. 
e 
visual appearance of undisturbed aqueous GO/MNP dis-
persions of di erent compositions provides important in-
direct evidence on the interparticle interactions and the 
colloidal stability of the system. As seen from the photograph 
of Figure 7(a), freshly homogenized suspensions undergo 
rapid coagulation and start to settle immediately forming 
large oc-like secondary particles when their GO/MNP 
ratios range between 1 and 0.1. Aggregation also occurs at 
di erent loadings, as indicated by the sharp settling front in 
GO-rich samples, while the settling rate gradually increases 
with the magnetite loading (Figure 7(b)). However, when 
MNPs are in large excess, sedimentation slows down and 
becomes more di use, with a considerable fraction of 
particles remaining in suspended form after 1 hour ageing. 
Nevertheless, within one day, the entire amount of nano-
composite particles settles down independent of their 
composition (Figure 7(c)). is is in sharp contrast with the 
settling behavior of the respective single-component parti-
cles (not shown), which retained their homogeneous spatial 
distribution in water for extended time periods. 
is 
macroscopic-scale observation is in excellent agreement 
with the one obtained by electron microscopy on the ex-
clusive occurrence of MNP particles on the GO host la-
mellae: both of them suggest that there is a strong interaction 
between the Fe 3 O 4 and the GO surfaces. One plausible 
explanation for the origin of the strong adhesive forces 
between these dissimilar colloidal particles is an extensive 
hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl group containing 
surfaces of GO and MNP (for the former, they are originally

part of the chemical structure, and for the latter, an 
abundance of Fe-OH surface sites form upon dissociative 
chemisorption of water molecules [57]). However, it is more 
likely that strong coulombic attraction forces arise when the 
two di erent colloidal particles are mixed together in water. 
To check the validity of this possibility, electrokinetic 
measurements were performed as detailed later. 
Turning back to the dispersion characteristics, the largest 
equilibrium sediment volume appears at the highest GO 
loadings, which is partly due to the fact that the total solid 
content in these suspension is larger (the mass concentration 
of MNP is always 5 g/L in the whole series, and the GO 
excess mass was speci ed to this value). However, it is also 
possible that GO lamellae constitute a "house of cards" 
arrangement opening up the nanostructure, and the loose 

aggregates form a more voluminous sediment than those 
which are composed mostly of magnetite. 
As a nal note here, one would expect black or very dark 
brown color for all dispersions. However, when the magnetic 
particles become dominant in the samples, they turn to 
orange especially at higher dilutions. is is simply because 
of slow atmospheric oxidation of Fe 3 O 4 to maghemite, 
but since this polymorph of iron oxide exhibits nearly the 
same magnetism and chemical properties [42], this trans-
formation does not change crucially the characteristics of the 
GO/MNP composites. 
Figure 8 shows the electrokinetic potentials and particle 
diameters (scattering intensity-based "Z-average") as the 
function of the composition. It is important to note that, in 
contrast to the general GO/MNP representation, it is

trophoretic migration [58]. 
is potential is usually lower 
than that measured at the particle surface, but its sign and 
magnitude are a good indication of the surface charge state 
and kinetic stability of the dispersed material. It is a common 
observation that electrostatically stabilized colloidal systems 
aggregate when the ζ potential falls within the range of 
±20 mV. Graphene oxide particles show ζ potential far lower 
than this value, indicating that their surfaces are highly 
charged in water, in agreement with previous observations 
[59]. On the other hand, +40 mV electrokinetic potential is

measured for naked magnetite nanoparticle sols at pH values 
below ∼5 [44]. For the binary composites, the charge increases 
slightly at the highest excesses of GO probably due to slight 
pH variation, but then it starts to increase gradually with the 
addition of magnetic nanoparticles. is suggests that MNPs 
are adsorbed to the surface of graphene oxide lamellae by 
electrostatic attraction upon which they progressively screen 
the surface charge and, concomitantly, decrease the magni-
tude of ζ potential. e interaction of oppositely charged GO 
and magnetite nanoparticles results in aggregation. Huge 
secondary particles form in the lower MNP/GO mass ratio 
region (Figure 8(b)) probably due to the bridging of GO 
lamellae via MNPs. is finding is in good harmony with the 
visual observation of voluminous sediments formed mainly at 
2/1 and 1/1 GO/MNP ratios after 1 day standstill (Figure 7 
(c)), typical for house-of-cards arrangement of aggregates 
formed from anisometric, two-dimensional particles. How-
ever, as the MNP/GO mass ratio further increases, the average 
hydrodynamic diameters of dispersed particles successively 
decrease reaching the submicron scale. is implies, in good 
agreement with the magnitude of the particle dimensions of 
the single composite particle shown in Figure 6, that the 
degree of aggregation decreases with MNP loading. Even-
tually, primary GO sheets densely coated by MNPs dominate 
in the dispersed phase. 

3.4. Performance of MNP/GO Composites in Magnetic 
Hyperthermia. 
e potential use of the magnetic nano-
composites is demonstrated by their heating efficiency for 
a potential future use in hyperthermic cancer therapy [60]. 
Hyperthermia treatment relies on the temperature rise in 
a medium induced by the Néel and Brownian relaxation of 
superparamagnetic nanoparticles [61, 62]. e magnetiza-
tion curve of the MNPs (Figure 9(a)) clearly proves that the 
iron oxide nanoparticles used in this study are in the 
superparamagnetic state exhibiting a saturation magneti-
zation of 67.6 emu/g. In Figure 9(b), the heating curves of 
GO/MNP composites at two different compositions are 
compared to the heating curve obtained for a magnetite 
suspension of the same solid content in the absence of 
carbonaceous lamellae. It was found that both nano-
composites generated larger heat effects than the suspension 
containing the magnetic nanoparticles as indicated by the 
relatively large difference in the temperature measured 
between the suspensions after 5 minutes of AC magnetic 
field exposure (7.29 °C for GO/MNP � 1/5, 5.27 °C for pristine 
magnetite). is enhancement in the heating efficiency is 
even more remarkable (&gt;75% for the 1/50 composite) if one 
takes into account that pure water also produces heat under 
the same experimental conditions, caused by eddy currents 
[61]. We attribute this additional heat production to a re-
sistance heating effect caused by Joule-losses of the graphene 
oxide particles. To our surprise, the hyperthermic effect was 
found to be larger at low GO loadings. Clearly, it is worth 
conducting further investigations, for example, on the 
composition dependence of the heating efficiency for these 
nanocomposite materials to tune their functionalities for 
specific applications. 

4. Conclusions 

e present study demonstrates that uniform GO/MNP 
nanocomposites can be easily formulated in a wide com-
position range utilizing the strong electrostatic interaction 
between their particles. Graphene oxide particles were able 
to accommodate MNPs that represent masses up to 50 times 
larger than the lamellar carbonaceous host. is develop-
ment is significant especially because strong binding can be 
maintained between naked MNPs and GO particles without 
chemical coupling, which would require preliminary efforts 
for functionalization of both MNPs and GO [15, 36, 63, 64]. 
Moreover, the present synthesis does not require harsh 
chemical treatments or elevated temperatures, thereby 
keeping the chemical structure of graphene oxide intact. is 
is a definite benefit compared to recent studies [65, 66] 
reporting on the preparation of MNP/GO composites by 
hydrothermal methods in which the temperature was 
maintained at 190 °C, where GO is expected to undergo 
significant thermal decomposition [67]. Finally, we showed 
that the method is versatile, enabling a large variation in the 
compositions affording highly different nanostructures 
ranging from "house of cards" arrangement of MNP-
decorated exfoliated graphite oxide particles to GO nano-
sheets matrixed into bulk amounts of magnetite.

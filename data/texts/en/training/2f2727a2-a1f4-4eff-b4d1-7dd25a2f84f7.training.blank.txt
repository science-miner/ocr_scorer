The present paper aims at sensing the temperature. A sensor metamaterial consisting of two concentric metallic rings and a thin 
metallic wire deposited on the surface of BaTiO3 substrate is reported. The use of BaTiO3 makes the resonant frequency of the 
structure shift as the temperature varies and makes the sensor applicable in many fields of applications. Numerical simulations and 
theoretical results are presented and compared to each other; there was a good agreement between them. This sensor is smaller, 
easier to fabricate, and very sensitive to the changes in temperatures. 

1. Introduction 

In this decade, metamaterials (MTM) or left handed materials 
(LHM) have attracted much attention among researchers 
in the microwave communities because of their unusual 
properties, such as negative permittivity [1], negative perme-
ability [2], and negative refractive index [3, 4]. These periodic 
materials are very useful for many fields of applications [5-7]. 
Recently, a great interest has been devoted to the application 
of metamaterials in sensing; hereafter, we have provided some 
researches in this concern. Ishimaru and his colleagues have 
studied a metamaterial based on surface plasmon resonance 
(SPR) sensors in GHz regime while the traditional SPR is 
usually operated in optical domain only [8]. Kabashin et al. 
in [9] have enhanced the SPR sensor's performances by using 
metamaterial. In [10], the authors have proposed a method 
of dielectric sensing using 𝜀 near zero narrow waveguide 
channels. In [11], Ekmekci and his colleague have studied a 
double sided square SRR (split ring resonator) topology for 
multipurpose sensor operating in 𝑋 band; this sensor exhibits 
a negative value of permeability for frequencies close to the 
magnetic resonance frequency of the SRR structure, whereas 
our suggested structure exhibits negative permittivity and 
negative permeability close to the magnetic resonance fre-
quency of the structure; in addition and according to [12] 
circular SRR can present a higher quality factor compared to 

square SRR. References [13, 14] have studied the application of 
a Terahertz metamaterial for chemical sensing and [15] have 
explained how metamaterials can offer solutions to overcome 
technical limitations of wireless sensors. 
Metamaterials are better in sensing than the conventional 
resonators (e.g., spiral coils), because they are easy and rapid 
in detection [16-18] and they can exhibit a strong localization 
and enhancement of fields; that is, they can improve the 
sensor's selectivity and sensibility [19] due to the application 
of an axial time varying magnetic field parallel to the particle 
plane in the orthogonal direction to the splits which creates 
a huge electric field density localized between them and 
presents higher signal and higher dips in their transmission 
spectrum, which results in a high quality factor 𝑄 compared 
to the conventional RF (radio frequency) resonators. This 
enables us to make telemetric measurements and to observe 
the operating frequency relatively easier [20]. Another 
advantage of the gaps existence in the MTM structure is the 
production of an additional capacitive effect which exhibits 
a lower resonance frequency (hence avoid the background 
absorption of the structure) and results in higher shift of the 
operating frequency with the same applied load, leading to 
higher sensitivity. The use of Barium titanate dielectric that 
is very sensitive to the changes of temperature makes our 
sensor more sensitive.

The aim of this paper is to design a high sensitive and 
smaller electrical sensor of temperature based on metamate-
rial operating in GHz regime. The proposed structure consists 
of a combination of two concentric circular metallic rings 
opened in the opposite sides commonly called SRR and a 
thin metallic wire placed on a dielectric substrate. Because 
the resonant frequency of the MTM structure is very sensitive 
to the changes of the capacitive effects (since its fundamental 
resonance behavior can be modeled by an 𝐿𝐶 circuit [21]) 
which are basically dependent on the resonator's topology 
and the substrate's parameters (i.e., substrate's thickness and 
relative permittivity), we have proposed a structure with a 
varying dielectric characteristics substrate. When the temper-
ature changes, the dielectric properties of the substrate of the 
MTM will change and this will affect the capacitance of the 
SRR and then a shift in the resonant frequency will appear; 
this will indicate the measured temperature. 
In this work, we have designed the equivalent circuit 
model of the proposed structure and we have derived the 
relations of its coefficients of reflexion and transmission using 
the ABCD Matrix approach; then we have compared them 
to those resulting from the simulation. The results were very 
close. In this study the metamaterial sensor is smaller, is easier 
to fabricate, possesses higher sensitivity, and is useful in a 
wide range of applications. The mechanism behind this is the 
use of a varying dielectric characteristics substrate. 

2. Design OF LHM 

The MTM structure is composed of a combination of PEC 
(perfect electric conductor) circular SRR and thin wire placed 
on a dielectric substrate of 0.1 mm of thickness (𝑡 𝑑 ); the length 
and width of this substrate are 2 mm and 2.5 mm, respectively. 
The external radius of the SRR is 𝑟 0 = 0.75 mm, the width 
of the two rings is 𝑑 = 0.18 mm, the spacing between them 
is 0.24 mm, the split of the outer ring is 0.4 mm, the split of 
the inner ring is equal to 0.2 mm, and the thickness of the 
rings is 𝑡 𝑚 = 0.035 mm; the wire has a 0.2 mm of width and 
1.8 mm of length. The substrate of this model is the Barium 
titanate dielectric BaTiO3 [22, 23] which is one of the best 
known and commonly used materials for electric ceramics 
due to its excellent dielectric, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric 
properties at and above room temperature. We have specially 
chosen this material because its relative permittivity has a 
big dependence with the temperature (see Figure 1) which 
can be tailored in a wide range of applications. Furthermore, 
this material is sintered at high temperatures. This allows an 
operation at very elevated temperatures. Figure 2 shows the 
proposed structure. 

3. Simulation and Equivalent Circuit Model 

The simulation of the MTM structure has been executed 
using the High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) soft-
ware. A perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) boundary condi-
tion was set along 𝑧-axis while the perfect electric conductor 
(PEC) boundary condition was set along 𝑦-axis. On the last 
two faces, we have set two ports rectangular waveguide for 
sensor measurements. The LHM structure was placed at the 
center of the waveguide.

Dielectric constants of BaTiO3 

Temperature ( ∘ C) 

Figure 1: Variation of the dielectric constant of BaTiO3 versus the 
temperature [22]. 

In Figure 3, we have studied the variation of the coef-
ficient of the transmission S21 versus the variation of the 
frequency using the commercial simulator HFSS to study the 
shift in the resonant frequency according to the variation of 
the temperature of the sensor. 
The effective permittivity of the LHM structure is dif-
ferent from the relative permittivity of the BaTiO3 substrate 
(𝜀 BaTiO3 ̸ 
= 𝜀 MTM structure ). We have calculated the effective 
permittivity 𝜀 eff and the effective permeability 𝜇 eff of the MTM 
structure using the Nicolson-Ross-Weir method [24]; the 
results are shown in Figure 4. 
We notice that the resonant frequency of the simulated 
structure is 2.3 GHz with return loss of −20 dB. The relative 
permittivity at this frequency is −12.19, whereas the relative 
permeability is −12.65. 

3.1. Study of the Effects of the Dielectric Substrate on the MTM 
Structure. The resonant frequency of the MTM structure is 
inversely related to the total capacitance 𝐶 𝑇 of the sensor 
𝑓 = 1/2𝜋√𝐿 𝑇 𝐶 𝑇 [21]; it is known that the capacitance is 
proportional to the dielectric constant 𝐶 = 𝜀(𝑙/𝑆), where 𝑆 
is area of a dielectric material, 𝑙 is the thickness of a dielectric 
material, and 𝜀 is dielectric material's permittivity. 
When 𝜀 increases, the capacitance of the sensor 𝐶 𝑇 
increases which will decrease the resonant frequency. The 
shift in the resonant frequency resulting from the variation of 
the permittivity will indicate the variation in the temperature 
since the dielectric characteristics of the BaTiO3 substrate are 
related to the temperature (see Figure 1). 
When a time harmonic external magnetic field is applied 
along 𝑧 axis of this structure, an electromotive force will 
create an induced current in the structure that will explain 
the inductive part of our system. 
Because the LHM structure has a size much smaller than 
the operating wavelength, we can describe its electromagnetic 
characteristics by lumped circuit components capacitors and 
inductors. The overall structure can be represented by an 𝐿𝐶 
circuit and the equivalent circuit model proposed for our

frequency at 40 ∘ C. 

LHM structure is shown in Figure 6, where 𝐿 models the total 
inductance of the two rings of the SRR, 𝐶 is the capacitance of 
the split in the inner and outer ring and the capacitance of the 
gap between them, 𝐶 𝑠 models the coupling between the SRR 
and the line, and 𝐿 𝑠 models the inductance of the wire. After 

calculation, we noticed 𝐿 ⋙ 𝑀, so the mutual inductance 
can be neglected and the inductive currents will be neglected. 
Figure 5 shows the distribution of the current around the 
wire and the SRR and demonstrates the previous conclusion.

LHM structure which affects its capacitance which depends 
inversely on the frequency of resonance of the structure. 
To obtain the effects of the temperature on the 𝑆 param-
eters and hence on the resonant frequency of the MTM 
structure, we have studied the variation of the dielectric 
characteristics of the BaTiO3 that are corresponding to 
well-known temperatures according to the variation of the 
resonant frequency of the MTM structure. In the interval of 
temperature from 20 ∘ to 150 ∘ , we have plotted the variation 
of the resonance frequency in function of temperature (see 
Figure 8). 
The minimum and maximum temperatures that can 
be detected by this sensor depend on the and 
maximum temperatures that can be supported by the BaTiO3 
substrate. 
The BaTiO3 material is sintered at high temperatures, 
which allows an operation at wide range temperatures [27]. 
So, TMax has a high value and because this material has 
no linear variation of the temperature in function of 𝜀, the 
variation of the resonance frequency will not have a linear 
variation in function of the temperature (when 𝜀 increases 
the resonant frequency of the MTM structure decreases; this 
is because the frequency is inversely proportional to the 
capacitive effect which is proportional to epsilon), but we 
can note that the curve is linear just in the intervals [20-40], 
[40-60], [60-120], and [120-140]. 
We have done this study in GHz regime, but the variations 
of the frequency are in the order of MHz; that is why in Table 1 
we have presented the sensibility of this sensor in MHz. 

4. Conclusion 

This paper presents a sensor of temperature using the meta-
material. We have studied the variations of the resonant 
frequency according to the permittivity of structure which 
depend on the temperature. 
We have proposed an equivalent circuit model of our 
LHM structure and using the software MATLAB we have

calculated the coefficients of reflection and transmission; the 
obtained curves are in accordance with those obtained by the 
HFSS. 
Using the two methods HFSS and Matrix ABCD, we 
can notice that the variation in the temperature involves a 
variation of the frequency of resonance and it is illustrated 
in a curve. 
Because the BaTiO3 has big dependence of the relative 
permittivity with the temperature, this sensor can be tailored 
in a wide range of applications. 
Based on the promising results of this sensor, believe 
that the use of the proposed sensor's topology will efficiently 
be used in various sensing applications including pressure 
and humidity and also in biological and chemical sensing for 
any region of wavelengths.

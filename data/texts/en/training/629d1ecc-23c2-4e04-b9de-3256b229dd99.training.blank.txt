Laminar cooling process is a large-scale, nonlinear system, so the temperature control of such system is a difficult and complex 
problem. In this paper, a novel modeling method and a GPC-PID based control strategy for laminar cooling process are proposed to 
control the global temperature curve to produce high quality steel. First, based on the analysis of the cooling process of laminar flow, 
a new TS fuzzy model which possesses intelligence and self-learning ability is established to improve the temperature prediction 
accuracy. Second, the target temperature curve can be divided into several subgoals and each subgoal can be described by a 
CARIMA type of model. Then, by the decentralized predictive control method, GPC-PID based control strategy is introduced 
to guarantee the laminar cooling process to achieve subtargets, respectively; in that way the steel plate temperature will drop along 
the optimal temperature curve. Moreover, by employing the dSPACE control board into the process control system, the matrix 
process ability is added to the production line without large-scale reconstruction. Finally, the effectiveness and performance of the 
proposed modeling and control strategy are demonstrated by the industrial data and metallography detection in one steel company. 

1. Introduction 

Nowadays, higher requirements have been posed for the 
property of steel plates in fields like shipbuilding, auto 
industry, bridge construction, and so forth. The property of 
steel plates and their microstructures are, to a large extent, 
determined by the accuracy of the temperature control in the 
cooling process [1, 2]. Controlling the steel final temperature 
in the cooling process after rolling has been a representative 
control problem for metallurgical engineering control and it 
has attracted considerable attention for the control commu-
nity. The final temperature, called coiling temperature (CT), 
determines the physical and mechanical properties of the 
steel product. However, in recent years higher requirements 
are proposed that the temperature curve of the whole process 
needs to be controlled to produce finer microstructure. Since 
the laminar cooling process only lasts for a very short time 
and is unidirectional, in practice the model predictive control 
(MPC) is the most widely used to control this process. 
Before the real-time control, a simulation must be done to 

calculate the initial inputs to achieve the desired temperature 
(coiling temperature). Therefore, establishing a model with 
high precision and efficiency is especially important [3]. 
There are two kinds of challenges in improving the pre-
cision of the target temperature during the control process. 
One challenge is to build a model with high efficiency and 
accuracy. There usually exist two different types of models 
in recent study: the physical model and the statistical model. 
In physical model, mechanism analysis is generally used to 
model the laminar cooling process, which is capable of fully 
reflecting the heat transfer conditions and then outputting 
relatively precise coiling temperature [4, 5]. However, the 
accuracy of this kind of model is difficult to be further 
improved owing to its nonlinearity, multicoupling, and mul-
tivariate parameters. In order to get more accurate results, 
artificial intelligent method is introduced to model the lami-
nar cooling process [6]. Also, there are many researches using 
neural network to control the laminar flow cooling process 
[1, 7]. Some studies use fuzzy logic to improve the accuracy of 
model [5, 8, 9]. The disadvantage of this method is that a large

number of plates have to be cooled for training the neural net-
work before the neural network is ready for use [10]. The accu-
racy of the statistical model is subject to the numbers of clas-
sification. Based on the analysis of those two models, a high 
efficiency model which combines both the physical model 
and the statistical model is proposed in this paper to control 
the laminar cooling process and avoid each natural defect. 
Another challenge is to design a high-efficiency control 
method in laminar cooling process. Many different control 
methodologies have been attempted; among them the model 
predictive control is the most common used. For example, 
Smith predictor control [11], element tracking control [12], 
self-learning control [13], and adaptive control [14] are 
employed to control the coiling temperature by using the 
simplified model. Most existing MPC methods use the ther-
modynamic model to estimate the spatial distribution of strip 
temperature and get a high precision of CT [2, 15]. In 
recent year, some of the scholars present various effective 
approaches that attempt to control the cooling rate and cool-
ing curve. Literature works [16-18] try to use distribute model 
predictive control to design a supervisory controller regulat-
ing the temperature curve. In [19] distributed and horizon-
varying model predictive control is applied to control the 
cooling rate and the fine temperature and gets a very good 
performance. However, those works are mostly verified in 
simulation or in the laboratory condition, no production 
results, and metal crystal detection is performed to verify 
the effectiveness. In the manufactory, the compute ability of 
control computer is usually not powerful enough to handle so 
many matrixes in one control cycle. To control the tempera-
ture curve of the whole process, an effective method should 
be designed to utilize in the industrial current environ-
ment without large-scale reconstruction or upgrade project. 
Besides, it is well known that controlling the coiling temper-
ature curve dropping along a designed optimal temperature 
can produce high quality of steel plate [8, 17-19]. However, in 
the manufactory, the temperature curve in the runout table 
usually is ignored, since controlling the final temperature to 
match the target temperature could get good steel. Further-
more, based on the existing equipment in the manufactory, 
the target temperature curve is impossible to control. 
Motivated by these recent developments in laminar cool-
ing control strategy and the demand of the industry produc-
tion, this paper presents a novelty modeling method and a 
GPC-PID based control strategy for computational and prac-
tical reason which could enhance the precision and flexibility 
of the manufactory control system. Developing an integrated 
modeling method and a controller for easy tuning and imple-
mentation are what we focus on most. While similar models 
and controls have been used and reported in the literature for 
laminar cooling process control, the novelty of the approach 
presented in this work lies in the following aspects. (a) The 
intelligent TS fuzzy model proposed combines the advantage 
of the data model and the physical model by adding the phys-
ical model with self-learning ability. (b) The coiling temper-
ature and the temperature curve could be controlled in one 
control method and could be chosen based on the demand. 
(c) The MPC type of control method contains both the 
CARIMA model based on stable point and the physical model 

of the whole process, and they are coordinated to be employed 
in the different steps of the control. (d) A practical and effec-
tive solution is provided for the using of the control strategy in 
the product line by the current condition without large-scale 
redevelopment of the control system in production line. 
The contents are organized as follows. Section 2 first 
describes the mechanism analysis and the method to build 
the physical model and then presents the intelligent modeling 
strategy of laminar cooling process. Section 3 presents the 
TS modeling and recognition method, and a data processing 
technology of the intelligent model is deduced. Section 4 
describes that the control strategy of the laminar cooling 
process to regulate the temperature curve is designed by 
setting subgoals along the production line and controlling the 
subgoals. The GPC-PID control algorithm is derived and pro-
vides a computing algorithm. The simulation results and the 
experimental validation of both model and control method 
are summarized in Section 5, followed by the conclusion in 
Section 6. 

2. Intelligent Modeling 

2.1. Mechanism Analysis. The laminar cooling process is 
illustrated in Figure 1. A laminar flow cooling process refers 
to a process in which rolled steel plates cool down in a laminar 
flow cooling zone; after that process the steel plate is cooled 
at preset temperature. The final temperature is also called 
the cooling temperature. The laminar cooling process is a 
very important part of iron-making industry to product high 
quality steel plate. It is used to cool a strip from a high tem-
perature about 800-1000 ∘ C down to a cooling temperature 
of roughly 400-680 ∘ C in the runout table, according to the 
steel grade and varieties. The runout table is about 145 m in 
length and 80 groups of spray headers are installed above and 
below it. The first 64 groups headers are for the main cooling 
section and the last 16 groups are for the fine section. When 
the steel plate is about to be cooled, firstly it is cooled by the 
main section to nearly the target temperature; then the fine 
section cools it to the target temperature more accurately. 
There are only 4 pyrometers located along the runout table, 
because in the cooling process a large amount of water vapor 
floating above the steel makes it impossible for the noncontact 
infrared sensor to measure the real temperature of the plate. 
The temperature could only be measured when the steel plate 
is out of the water. 
The laminar flow is cooled through various means, such 
as water cooling heat transfer, air convection heat dissipation, 
thermal radiation dissipation, and phase change latent heat 
and the velocity of steel plates and spayed water quantum are 
controllable in the cooling process. It is important to figure 
out the extent to which each influencing factor may affect the 
laminar cooling process by using the laminar cooling pro-
duction data and conventional laminar flow cooling model. 
Table 1 lists the heat dissipation amount of different kinds of 
1000 kg-weighted steel plates and their mean value. 
From Table 1 and Figure 2 it can be seen that although 
certain amount of heat is released in phase change of steel 
plates, heat dissipation takes the main role in laminar flow 
cooling process. As being calculated, the heat transferred by

water cooling accounts for over 86% of the total heat dis-
sipation. However, in a laminar flow cooling process, only 
water cooling heat transfer is controllable by adjusting the 
flux of water and water cooling time. Therefore, except for 
water cooling transferred heat, the heat dissipated through 
other means can be replaced by a theoretical value and its 
difference from the actual quantity can be considered as a part 
of water cooling transferred heat. As long as the water cooling 
transferred heat quantum is calculated reasonably, we can get 
relatively accurate total heat dissipation and curl temperature: 

𝑑𝑄 𝑐 = −𝐹 ⋅ 𝛼 ⋅ (𝑇 𝑠 − 𝑇 𝑤 ) ⋅ 𝑑𝜏, 
(1) 

where 𝑑𝑄 𝑐 is the amount of heat loss through convection at 
unit time, J/s, including heat losses through water-cooling 
and air convection; 𝑇 𝑠 is strip temperature, ∘ C; 𝑇 𝑤 is the 
cooling water temperature, ∘ C; 𝐹 is the contact surface area 
between the plate and the cooling water, m 2 ; 𝑑𝜏 is the contact 

cooling time, s; 𝛼 is the heat convection constant, represent-
ing the heat exchange intensity at unit area, W/(m 2 ⋅K). 
According to formula (1), the key parameter affecting 
water cooling heat dissipation is water cooling heat transfer 
coefficient 𝑎 𝑤 , which is temperature-dependent. Since tem-
perature is not a constant, it is very hard to calculate this 
coefficient accurately. In addition, subject to the influence of 
water temperature and the movement of steel plate, it is nearly 
unrealistic to determine water cooling heat transfer coeffi-
cient by one formula only. In view of these, we use TS model 
method of water cooling heat transfer coefficient to solve the 
problems described above. 

2.2. Modeling Structure. The intelligent model built in this 
paper refers to the physical model and combines with the data 
processing method to structure a kind of model which owns 
data self-learning ability. The model requires two aspects 
performances, since the laminar cooling process is large-
scale, short-time, nonlinear characteristics. Firstly, based on 
the process inputs, the model should calculate the strip tem-
perature accurately, in order to provide the initial setting of 
the production line. Secondly, the production line is so rapid 
that fast calculation of the model is needed; consequently the 
structure of the model should be simple and efficient. The 
novel type of modeling strategy for laminar cooling process 
is shown in Figure 3. 
The intelligent model contains three parts: the mech-
anism model, the TS Fuzzy model, and the self-learning 
model. The mechanism model is the traditional model with-
out the water cooling heat transfer coefficient which is deter-
mined by the TS fuzzy model. The intelligent model tries to 
use the output of the TS fuzzy model to substitute the water 
cooling heat transfer coefficient function. The self-learning 
model processes data collected from the production line 
to identify the parameter of the TS model. A database is

included in the model of the self-learning model which 
contains sets of newest data collected from the product line. 
The self-learning model identifies the TS fuzzy parameters at 
each identification period and transfers them to the TS fuzzy 
model. Then, the fuzzy model calculates 𝑎 𝑤 which is the most 
important parameter in mechanism model to get the strip 
output. 
In TS fuzzy model, offline and online methods work 
together. Offline method is used to get initial parameters with 
massive data; online method continuously collects the pro-
ducing data of laminar flow cooling process and updates the 
parameters of TS fuzzy model to make it adaptive to the prod-
uct line. In this way, our intelligent model acquires self-study 
ability. 
Although the TS fuzzy model is rapid and accurate, it 
needs many pieces of data to adjust the model. At the start of 
the calculation, the TS fuzzy model's precision cannot meet 
the need of the product. In order to increase the robustness 
of the system, two complementary strategies are introduced. 
Besides the fuzzy model, the improved method of the tradi-
tional equation is used. The traditional equation of the water 
cooling heat transfer coefficient cannot adjust its parameters 
although the production environment is constantly changing, 
but it is robustness. Once the equation parameters are deter-
mined, it could immediately calculate the output according to 
the input. Based on the above reasons, the TS fuzzy model is 
combined with the improved equation to achieve the robust-
ness and accuracy of the system. 

3. TS Modeling of the Laminar Cooling 

Actually, TS fuzzy model is a model with a fixed input-output 
relationship. As long as an appropriate input-output relation-
ship is determined, system recognition can be fulfilled and a 
TS fuzzy model can be thus obtained [20]. Although water

cooling heat transfer coefficient is very important, it is diffi-
cult to be determined, so TS fuzzy modeling method is uti-
lized to estimate water cooling heat transfer coefficient with 
real production parameter. 

3.1. TS Model. The input-output relationship of water cooling 
heat transfer coefficient is shown as Figure 4. Provided that 
the initial temperature 𝑇 0 , cooling temperature 𝑇 𝑐 , and water 
density 𝑞 𝑤 of a laminar cooling process are known, the aver-
age water cooling heat transfer coefficient can be determined. 
The input-output relationship of TS fuzzy model is deter-
mined by Figure 4. 
TS fuzzy model has some advantages: it can describe 
highly nonlinear complex system with few regular numbers; 
its structure and parameters can be easily adjusted; it makes 
system analysis and conventional controller design easier. 
Due to the fact that it is simple in structure and fast in calcu-
lation, TS fuzzy model is chosen by us as a predicting model 
[20-22]. 
TS fuzzy model works in this way: (1) create a few 
fuzzy regulations; (2) each regulation deals with parameters 
belonging to certain zone; (3) these regulations work together 
to form an integral fuzzy regulation space; (4) use this fuzzy

regulation space to describe its output. The process of the TS 
fuzzy model was shown in Figure 5. 
The contribution of the 𝑖th TS fuzzy rules to the system 
was expressed in the form of "If. . .Then" statement as follows: 

𝑅 𝑖 : If x 1 (𝑘) is A 𝑖 
1 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ and x 𝑛 (𝑘) is A 𝑖 

𝑛 

Then y 𝑖 (𝑘 + 1) = 𝑝 𝑖 
0 + 𝑝 𝑖 
1 𝑥 1 + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ + 𝑝 𝑖 
𝑛 x 𝑛 ; 𝑖 = 1, 2, . . . , 𝑐, 

(2) 

where 𝑐 is the number of fuzzy rules, 𝑛 is the input variables 
number of the T-S fuzzy model, x 1 (𝑘), x 2 (𝑘), . . . , x 𝑛 (𝑘) are the 
regressive variables consisting of output and input data at the 
𝑘th instance and before, x(𝑘) = [𝑥 1 (𝑘), 𝑥 2 (𝑘), . . . , 𝑥 𝑛 (𝑘)] is 
the input vector of the T-S fuzzy model, A 𝑖 
1 , A 𝑖

𝑛 are 
the membership functions associated with the 𝑖th rule, and 
𝑝 𝑖 
0 , 𝑝 𝑖 
1 , . . . , 𝑝 𝑖 
𝑛 are the consequent parameters of the submodel 
(fuzzy rules) 𝑖. 
We denote 𝛽 𝑖 as the fitness grade of the submodel 𝑖, and 
thus the model output y(𝑘 + 1) at the (𝑘 + 1)th instance can 
be calculated as follows [21]: 

y (𝑘) =

(3) 

where 𝑟 = 𝑐 ⋅ (𝑛 + 1); then we can get 

y (𝑘) = Φ (𝑘) 𝑇 × Θ (𝑘) . 
(4) 

Generally speaking, the antecedent structure identifica-
tion is completed through fuzzy clustering based on the 
principle of a fuzzy 𝐶-mean (FCM) algorithm and the conse-
quent parameters are identified according to the least squares 
method [22]. 

3.2. TS Model Recognition. For a TS fuzzy model, the most 
important thing is to acquire antecedent and consequent 
parameters. The consequent parameters are acquired by fuzzy 
cluster method based on fuzzy 𝐶 mean value algorithm, and 
consequent parameters are obtained with least squared 
method. 
Follow the steps below to recognize antecedent and con-
sequent parameters by inputting x(𝑘) and y(𝑘 + 1): 

(1) Use 𝐶 cluster algorithm to recognize the subordinate 
degree function u 𝑖 of x(𝑘). 

(2) When the input equals x(𝑘), the fitness of the 𝑖th 
regulation to the system output can be calculated by 

𝛽 𝑖 = 

𝑐 

∑ 

𝑗=1 

( 
𝑢 𝑖 
𝑢 𝑗 
) , 𝑖 = 1, 2, . . . , 𝑐. 
(5) 

Its vector can be calculated by 

Φ (𝑘) 

= [𝛽 1 , . . . , 𝛽 𝑐 , 𝛽 1 𝑥 1 (𝑘) , . . . , 𝛽 𝑐 𝑥 1 (𝑘) , . . . , 𝛽 𝑐 𝑥 𝑛 (𝑘)] 
𝑇 . 
(6) 

(3) As y(𝑘 + 1) and Φ(𝑘) are both known quantities, 
according to formula y(𝑘 + 1) = Φ(𝑘)Θ(𝑘), we can 
get 

Θ (𝑘) = (Φ 𝑇 Φ) 
−1 Φ 𝑇 ⋅ y (𝑘 + 1) . 
(7) 

3.3. Data Processing of the Intelligent Model. The data col-
lected in laminar cooling process may deviate from normal 
range due to controlling failure or a jammed water valve, so it 
is necessary to shim the collected production data. After the 
statistical analysis of laminar flow cooling process data and 
theoretical analysis, the relationship between production data 
can be summarized: 

𝑇 𝑐 = 𝑇 0 − 
𝑐 ⋅ 𝑛 
𝑎 ⋅ ℎ ⋅ V 
, 

𝑅 = Ṫ𝑐 = 
Δ𝑡 𝑏 
𝐿/V 
, 

(8) 

where 𝑇 𝑐 is the crimp temperature, ∘ C; 𝑇 0 is the initial tem-
perature, ∘ C; ℎ is the plate thickness, m, and 𝑛 is the number

the average velocity of the steel plate, m/s, 𝐿 is the length of 
the product line, m; 𝑎, 𝑐 are the coefficient of the production 
line. If the difference of 𝑇 𝑐 + 𝑅 obtained by substituting the 
collected data 𝑛, 𝐿, Δ𝑡 𝑏 into formula from the actual collected 
data is over 10%, the collected data will be eliminated. 
As TS fuzzy model needs to recognize the production data 
in real time, the more data it gets, the more accurate its output 
will be. However large amount of data requires large data 
storage space and long time for data recognizing; therefore, it 
is necessary to provide a suitable storage space for it. Table 2 
shows us the results calculated by a computer with 3.0 GHz 
CPU, 4 G memory. 
Mean square error is calculated by comparing data col-
lected in real time and data generated by model. Recognizing 
time is the time that MATLAB spends on TS model parame-
ter recognizing. According to the table, when the data reaches 
1000 sets, mean square error can be kept less than 10 ∘ C and 
calculating time is also acceptable. Increasing more data can 
no longer obviously improve the accuracy of model, so just 
keeping 1000 sets of product data is acceptable. Then all the 
work needed to build the intelligent model was completed. 
The total process of the intelligent model is shown as Figure 6. 

4. Control System 

In order to improve the quality of the steel plate, the control 
system in the manufactory needs to be improved to produce 
higher quality and performance steel plate. The existing 
method in industrial manufactory tries to control the cooling 
temperature. The average cooling rate is regarded as the real 
cooling rate of the steel plate. So the opened header groups 
𝑁 0 is computed as follows: 

𝑁 0 = 
V 𝑐 
𝑙 
⋅ 
𝑇 0 − 𝑇 𝑐 
𝑅 𝑐 
, 
(9) 

where 𝑇 0 is the start temperature, 𝑇 𝑐 is the cooling tempera-
ture, 𝑙 is the length of the runout table, the V 𝑐 is the average 
speed of the steel (usually the speed is changing all the time), 
and 𝑅 𝑐 is the average temperature drop caused by one group 
of headers. 
In manufactory, 𝑁 0 sometimes is given by experienced 
engineers according by the common configure of one type of 
steel. In some of more advanced factory, the laminar cooling 
model induces the engineers to calculate the initial setting 
of the production line. Although many intelligent cooling 
models with high accuracy are established and the final tem-
perature of the steel plate is controlled precisely, the cooling 
rate is not properly handled. Reference [16] presents a kind 
of distributed model predictive control for plant-wide hot-
rolled strip laminar cooling process, but the laminar cooling 
process is very fast, the sampling period only lasts within one

ability to handle too many matrices in a single sampling 
period. A series of high speed and accuracy control strategies 
is needed to control the whole curve of the cooling tempera-
ture. 
The control strategy is shown in Figure 7, the model gives 
the initial setting of the process, and local PID controllers 
control their local target. If the subtarget temperatures are

properly handled, the steel plate temperature will drop along 
the setting temperature curve. 

4.1. Subgoal Setting. The whole system is divided into 𝑁 
subsystem; the system ranges from 1 to 𝑛. If the speed is con-
trolled in a constant, the running time is determined by the 
location. The desired geometrically location-dependent tem-
peratures are selected at the locations 𝐿1, 𝐿2, 𝐿3, . . . , 𝐿𝑛 as the 
reference temperatures with the notation 𝑟 = [𝑟1, 𝑟2, . . . , 𝑟𝑛]. 
The process is shown in Figures 8 and 9. When the type of the 
steel plate is determined, its optimal cooling curve is certain. 
The discrete reference point 𝑟 needs to be selected to reflect 
the characteristics of the optimal cooling curve. The number 
of sampling points is determined by the need of the control 
precision. The appropriate number of sampling points is the 
balance of the quickness and accuracy. 

4.2. Submodel. Unlike other kinds of the laminar cooling 
models, the relationship between the inputs and outputs near 
the reference temperature are described by the CARIMA 
model. The steel plate exchanges heat with outside mainly 
through three ways: heat conduction and thermal radiation 
and heat convection. 
The surface layer is described as follows: 

𝑑𝑄 0 = 𝑑𝑄 radiation + 𝑑𝑄 convection + 𝑑𝑄 0,1 , 

𝑑𝑄 radiation = −𝐴 𝑟 ⋅ 𝜀 ⋅ 𝜎 ⋅ [(𝑇 𝑠 ) 
4 − (𝑇 𝑎 )

4.3. GPC-PID Control Method. The generalized predictive 
control (GPC) is chosen as a basis for predictive PID for two 
major reasons. First, the receding horizon solution of GPC 
can be described easily in a linear polynomial representation. 
In comparison, the receding form of DMC is cumbersome 
because it is based on a convolution model. Second, GPC is 
a generalized strategy which includes all desirable properties 
of the industry proven MPC formulations [23]. It is assumed 
that the plant is adequately represented by the CARIMA 
model: 

A (𝑧 −1 ) y (𝑘) = B (𝑧 −1 ) 𝑧 −𝑑 u (𝑘) + 
C (𝑧 −1 ) 𝜉 (𝑘) 

Δ 
, 
(15) 

where 

A (𝑧 −1 ) = 1 + 𝑎 1 𝑧 −1 + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ + 𝑎 𝑛 𝑎 𝑧 −𝑛 𝑎 , 

B (𝑧 −1 ) = 𝑏 0 + 𝑏 1 𝑧 −1 + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ + 𝑏 𝑛 𝑏 𝑧 𝑛 𝑏 , 

C (𝑧 −1 ) = 𝑐 0 + 𝑐 1 𝑧 −1 + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ + 𝑐 𝑛 𝑐 𝑧 𝑛 𝑐 , 

(16) 

where 𝑧 −1 is the backward shift operator. y(𝑡) is the plant 
output or the measured output signal, u(𝑡) is the control 
input, 𝜉(𝑡) is the noise that disturbs the output signal, and 
Δ = 1 − 𝑧 −1 . 
To derive a GPC law that minimizes the performance 
index, two Diophantine equations are solved: 

1 = A (𝑧 −1 ) E 𝑗 (𝑧 −1 ) Δ + 𝑧 −𝑗 F 𝑗 (𝑧 −1 ) , 

E 𝑗 (𝑧 −1 ) B (𝑧 −1 ) = G 𝑗 (𝑧 −1 ) + 𝑧 −𝑗 H 𝑗 (𝑧 −1 ) , 

(17) 

where 

E 𝑗 (𝑧 −1 ) = 1 + 𝑒 𝑗,1 𝑧 −1 + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ + 𝑒 𝑗,𝑗−1 𝑧 −(𝑗−1) , 

F 𝑗 (𝑧 −1 ) = 𝑓 𝑗,0 + 𝑓 𝑗,1 𝑧 −1 + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ + 𝑓 𝑗,𝑛 𝑎 𝑧 −𝑛 𝑎 , 

G 𝑗 (𝑧 −1 ) = 𝑔 0 + 𝑔 1 𝑧 −1 + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ + 𝑔 𝑗−1 𝑧 −𝑗+1 , 

H 𝑗 (𝑧 −1 ) = ℎ 𝑗,0 + 𝑔 𝑗,1 𝑧 −1 + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ + 𝑔 𝑗,𝑛 𝑏 −1 𝑧 −𝑛 𝑏 +1 . 

(18) 

The 𝑗 steps ahead predictive output is given as follows: 

y (𝑡 + 𝑗) = G 𝑗 Δu (𝑡 + 𝑗 − 1) + F 𝑖 y (𝑡) + H 𝑗 Δu (𝑡 − 1) 

+ E 𝑗 w (𝑡 + 𝑗) . 
(19) 

E 𝑗 w(𝑡 + 𝑗) is the disturbance signal, and the vector form of 
the optimal predictive outputs is expressed as follows: 

y = Gu + Fy (𝑡) + HΔu (𝑡 − 1) , 
(20) 

where 

y 𝑇 = [𝑦 (𝑡 + 1) , . . . , 𝑦 (𝑡 + 𝑁)] , 

u 𝑇 = [Δu (𝑡) , . . . , Δu (𝑡 + 𝑁 − 1)] , 

F 𝑇 = (𝐹 1 , . . . , 𝐹 𝑁 ) ,

The future reference trajectory is defined as y 𝑟 = [y 𝑟 (𝑘 +

where y 𝑟 is the setpoint, 𝑁 is the control horizon, and Q is the 
control weight: 

Q 1 (𝑧 −1 ) = 𝑞 1

The vector form is described as follows: 

𝐽 = 𝐸 {(y − y 𝑟 )

(24) 

The optimal solution with respect to Δu is obtained as 

Δu = (G 𝑇 G + 𝜆I)

Mathematical Problems in Engineering 

The incremental discrete PID control law is developed by 
starting with the noninteracting continuous algorithm given 
by 

𝑢 (𝑡) = 𝑘 𝑝 [𝑒 (𝑡) +

𝑇 𝐼 
∫

𝑡 

0 

𝑒 (𝑡) 𝑑𝑡 + 𝑘 𝐷 
𝑑𝑒 (𝑡) 
𝑑𝑡 
, 

(27) 

where u(𝑡) is the input of the control system, 𝑘 𝑝 is the 
proportional constants, 𝑘 𝐼 is the integral constants, 𝑘 𝐷 is 
the derivative constants, and 𝑒(𝑡) is the error. The transfer 
function can be written as follows: 

𝐺 𝑐 (𝑠) = 
𝑈 (𝑠) 
𝐸 (𝑠) 
= 
𝑘 𝑝 𝑇 𝐷 𝑇 𝐼 𝑠 2 + 𝑘 𝑝 𝑇 𝐼 𝑠 + 𝑘 𝑝 

𝑇 𝐼 𝑠 
. 
(28) 

A first-order discretization of the results is given in the 
following discrete control law: 

𝑢 (𝑡) = 𝑢 (𝑡 − 1) + 𝑝 0 𝑒 (𝑡) + 𝑝 1 𝑒 (𝑡) + 𝑝 2 𝑒 (𝑡 − 2) , 

𝐺 𝑐 (𝑧) = 
𝑝 0 + 𝑝 1 𝑧 −1 + 𝑝 2 𝑧 −1 
1 − 𝑧 −1 
. 

(29) 

Compared with (26), we have the following:

Discrete expression of PID controller is described as 
follows: 

𝐿 (𝑧 −1 ) 𝑢 (𝑡) = 𝑀 (𝑧 −1 ) 𝑦 𝑟 (𝑡) − 𝑁 (𝑧 −1 ) 𝑦 (𝑡) . 
(31)

(32) 

According to the result of the above derivation, the PID 
parameters can be rewritten, to get the self-tuning PID con-
troller parameters: 

𝑢 (𝑡) = 
𝑘 𝐼 
1 − 𝑧 −1 𝑒 (𝑡) − [𝑘 𝑝 + (1 − 𝑧 −1 ) 𝑘 𝐷 ] 𝑦 (𝑡) . 
(33) 

Then get the following results: 

(1 − 𝑧 −1 ) 𝑢 (𝑡) = 𝑘 𝐼 𝑦 𝑟 (𝑡) 

− [𝑘 𝐼 + (1 − 𝑧 −1 ) 𝑘 𝑝 + (1 − 𝑧 −1 ) 𝑘 𝐷 ] 𝑦 (𝑡) 

= 𝑘 𝐼 𝑦 𝑟 (𝑡) 

− [(𝑘 𝐼 + 𝑘 𝑝 + 𝑘 𝐷 ) − (𝑘 𝑝 + 2𝑘 𝐷 ) 𝑧 −1 + 𝑘 𝐷 𝑧 −2 ] 

⋅ 𝑦 (𝑡) . 

(34) 

Compare the PID with GPC:

Finally, the GPC-PID control algorithm is gotten: 

(1) Firstly, the model of the control plate needs to be 
identified to get A(𝑧 −1 ), B(𝑧 −1 ) in the CARIMA 
model. 

(2) Calculate the G 𝑗 (𝑧 −1 ), F 𝑗 (𝑧 −1 ) by solving the Dio-
phantine equation. 

(3) Then, the control input Δu = (G 𝑇 G+𝜆I) −1 G 𝑇 (y 𝑟 −y 1 ). 

(4) Compute the PID control parameters 𝑘 𝐼 , 𝑘 𝐷 , 𝑘 𝑝 . 

(5) Get the control input u(𝑡). 

Now the design of GPC-PID control method for laminar 
cooling process is completed and some experiments are 
presented in the next section. 

5. Validation of the Modeling and 
Control Method 

5.1. Modeling. The model is built in MATLAB/Simulink 
environment, and the results are calculated by a computer 
with 3.0 GHz CPU, 4 G memory. 

5.1.1. Validation of the System Model. To test the validation 
of this method, some experiments are conducted using real 
industrial data. The type of steel X80 is chosen to validate the 
model. 
Use the method described above to model a laminar flow 
cooling process, filter abnormal data, recognize parameter 
with 1000 sets of effective data, substitute the parameter into 
TS fuzzy model, and then collect 300 sets of production data 
to verify the output results. 

5.1.2. Comparison between the Traditional Model and Intel-
ligent Model. Figures 10 and 11 compare the results of the 
conventional mechanism model data and TS model data with 
real producing data, respectively. It is obvious that TS fuzzy 
model gives us a more accurate result than conventional 
mechanism model in Figure 12. 
From Table 3, the TS fuzzy model can largely improve 
the accuracy of a laminar flow cooling model. The cooling 
temperature predicted by TS fuzzy model is matched well 
with real production data, with the difference between them 
kept less than 10 ∘ C. Also, the error between TS modeling data 
and real production data is largely reduced; and mean square 
error can be reduced by 50% compared to conventional 
model.

5.1.3. Output of the Intelligent Model. The intelligent model 
is validated in the last section, so the output could reflect 
the reality of the laminar cooling process. Figure 13 shows 
the whole temperature curve of the steel along the thickness 
direction. The initial temperature is about 800 ∘ C-900 ∘ C; 
when the steel plate enters the main cooling zone the tem-
perature of the surface layer will largely drop, but the inside 
layer's temperature is still very high because the heat inside 
should be release through conduct with the outside layer. So 
the internal layer's temperature will be hysteretic compared 
with the surface layers. There will be internal and external 
temperature difference when the steel enters the cooling zone. 
On the other hand, when the plate is running out of the 
cooling zone, the cooling rate of the surface will decrease,

but the internal is still very hot, so the heat flows from 
internal layer to external layer. The phenomenon will show 
that the internal temperature still declines while the external 
temperature rises. This phenomenon is clearly expressed in 
Figure 13. 
The intelligent model could compute the temperature 
differences between the internal and the external layer of the 
plate shown in Figure 14(a). Figure 14(b) shows the average 
temperature curve of the steel. The model also could calculate 
other parameters difficult to be directly measured in the 
laminar cooling process, shown in Figures 14(c)-14(f). 

5.2. Control Strategy 

5.2.1. Experimentation. To illustrate the performance of pro-
posed modeling and control method, application of this 
method to laminar cooling process test is performed in one 
steel testing product line in Hubei, China. The control system 
is shown in Figure 15. In the factory, the initial control system 
is very difficult for the improvement of the equipment and is 
not convenient for the use of the new control algorithm, since 
the Distributed Control System (DCS) could not process 
the matrix. As a consequence, new equipment needs to be 
introduced to solve that disadvantage. 
The dSPACE control system, DS1103 PPC Controller 
Board, is utilized to add the intelligent model to the con-
trol system without large-scale reconstruction of the initial 
control system. The controller board is designed to meet the 
requirements of modern rapid control prototyping and is 
highly suitable for applications. The DS1103 is an all-rounder 
in rapid control prototyping. It can be mounted in a dSPACE 

Expansion Box or dSPACE AutoBox to test new control 
functions in a laboratory or directly in the product line. The 
dSPACE 1103 PPC system has a PowerPC Type CPU, PPC 
750 GX, with CPU clock 1 GHz. The unparalleled number of 
I/O interfaces makes the DS1103 a versatile controller board 
for numerous applications. 
The initial control system only provides several interfaces 
to collect data provided by the intelligent model running 
in the dSPACE system. The dSPACE system could run the 
intelligent model; meanwhile the process is going to exchange 
information with the laminar cooling process. At the start of 
the cooling process, the intelligent model calculates the initial 
input of the control system based on the known initial infor-
mation of the production line, such as the beginning temper-
ature of the steel plate, the target temperature, the thickness, 
the type, and the grade of the steel. Before the laminar cooling 
process is ongoing, the intelligent model calculates the 
parameters of the CARIMA model and the PID parameters 
of all the temperature control points and then passes data 
to the industrial computer and PLC controller. The PID 
parameters will not be changed in one cooling process of 
one type of steel. Although processing the matrix in GPC 
algorithm is a very complex work, it is not calculated every 
control period. Instead, the control outputs are based on the 
PID control and other kinds of control methods such as feed-
forward and feedback control. In this way the control strategy 
will be robust and will be easily handled for the engineers. 

5.2.2. Performance of Proposed Controller. In the manufac-
tory, the control target of the laminar cooling contains two 
related aspects: the cooling temperature (CT) and the whole 
temperature curve (TC). The CT is the last temperature point 
in TC which is important for the cooling, and the TC plays 
important role in the construction of the microstructure of 
the steel. Figure 16 shows that the CT is well controlled in 
the manufactory by the strategy proposed above. The control 
variables are shown in Figure 17. Figure 18 shows the temper-
ature curve dropping along the subgoals. 

5.2.3. Physical Verification. To validate the control method, a 
metallography detection is carried on in a research institute 
in Wuhan, China. The WL510 type of steel is selected and the 
crystal structure of iron is detected through Zeiss metallo-
graphic microscope. Figures 19(a)-19(c) are the steel cooled 
in laminar cooling process with just the CT controlled, while 
Figures 19(e) and 19(f) show that the temperature control is 
in line with the designed curve. (a, d) is the surface impurity 
detection. (b, e) is at the thickness of 1/4, while (c, f) is at 
the 1/2 thickness. The comparison between the two groups 
of metallographic pictures shows that the TC control makes 
fewer impurities and avoids the widmanstatten and a large 
crystal structure harmful to mechanical property. 

6. Conclusion 

In this study, a novelty modeling method and GPC-PID con-
trol strategy are presented to control the temperature curve in 
laminar cooling process. First, the cooling mechanism in lam-
inar cooling process is investigated; then the TS fuzzy model

which boasts high self-study ability by combining data 
filtering method and parameter recognizing method is intro-
duced into the intelligent model. The new modeling method 
proposed by this paper enables the intelligent laminar flow 
cooling model to monitor the process of a laminar flow 
cooling process rapidly. Second, several subgoals based on the 
location of the runout table are set to make the temperature 
curve be realized with a few computational burdens. In order 
to guarantee the steel plate cooling along the target temper-
ature curve, the GPC-PID control method is implemented, 
which makes the distributed PID controllers achieve the sub-
goals. Third, the dSPACE control board which is running the 
intelligent model is provided to make the GPC-PID applied 

in the control system without large-scale reconstruction. 
Finally, the data collected from the real production line 
demonstrates the efficiency and precision of the control strat-
egy formulated in this paper, and the metallography detection 
by the metallographic microscope indicates that applying 
the temperature curve control can obtain finer microstruc-
ture compared with the CT control. 
Although a practical modeling and an effective control 
strategy have been proposed to obtain an ideal result success-
fully, there are still some improvements to be accomplished 
further about this work. First, the number of the subgoals 
cannot be added more than 6 due to the complexity of the 
control method and the constraint of the calculative ability of

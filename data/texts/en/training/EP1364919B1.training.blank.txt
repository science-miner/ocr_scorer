Description 

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 

1. Field of Invention 

[0001] The present invention relates to an optical fiber 
manufacture method and a preform manufacture method 
that can manufacture a preform and an optical fiber with 
reduced variation in their diameters. 

2. Description of Related Art 

[0002] Fig. 1 shows a conventional glass base material 
first elongating apparatus 400. A glass base material 102, 
which is a base material of an optical fiber, is usually 
elongated by the glass base material first elongating ap-
paratus 400. This reduces the diameter of the glass base 
material 102, to produce a glass rod 106. The glass rod 
106 has a diameter from 3 mm to 5 mm larger than the 
most convenient diameter to draw an optical fiber. The 
most convenient diameter for drawing an optical fiber is 
30 mm to 80 mm. 
[0003] A glass base material first elongating apparatus 
400 comprises a heating furnace 100 that heats the glass 
base material 102 and a drawing chuck 104 that holds 
and elongates the heated glass base material 102. To 
elongate the glass base material 102, the glass base 
material first elongating apparatus 400 supplies the glass 
base material 102 to the heating furnace 100. Here the 
glass base material 102 is heated to approximately 
2000°C. The first elongating apparatus 400 then holds 
the glass base material 102 by the drawing chuck 104, 
and draws the glass base material 102 from the heating 
furnace 100 downward continuously to form a glass rod 
106. 
[0004] Fig. 2 shows a configuration of a conventional 
glass lathe 110. The glass rod 106 made by the glass 
base material first elongating apparatus 400 undergoes 
secondary elongation by the glass lathe 110 to produce 
a preform 107. At this time, the diameter of the glass rod 
106 is reduced to prescribed diameter. The glass lathe 
110 comprises chucks 118 and 119 that hold the glass 
rod 106, a tail stock 116 which moves the chuck 119, and 
a heating source 122 which heats the glass rod 106. One 
chuck 118 is fixed, and the other chuck 119 movable. A 
traction force can be applied to the chuck 119. The glass 
rod 106, which is held by the chucks 118 and 119, is 
heated by the heating source 122. The heated glass rod 
106 is elongated by moving the tail stock 116 which pulls 
the glass rod 106. The result is, the diameter of the glass 
rod 106 reduces to become the prescribed diameter. 
[0005] There was the possibility of manufacturing bent 
glass rods 106 when using a conventional glass base 
material first elongating apparatus 400 to elongate the 
glass base material 102. Also, when using a conventional 
glass lathe 110 to elongate the glass rod 106 to manu-
facture the preform 107 further problems often arose. 

These problems included variation in the diameter of the 
preform 107 because the amount of gas provided to the 
heating source 122 and the speed of moving the tail stock 
116 differed for each preform 107 produced. 
[0006] When elongating a bent glass rod 106, which 
is made by a conventional glass base material first elon-
gating apparatus 400, to make a preform 107 by the glass 
lathe 110, the diameter of the preform 107 varied. When 
manufacturing optical fibers by drawing a preform 107 
with a varying diameter, the diameter of the optical fibers 
produced also varies. This makes it difficult to manufac-
ture an optical fiber of high quality. 
[0007] Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 11, no. 167, 28

A disclose an automatic drawing device for a preform of 
an optical fiber. Both ends of the preform are each held 
by revolvable chuck. One of the chucks is stationary and 
the other is movable in the axial direction of the preform. 
A part of the preform is heated by a burner and simulta-
neously drawn by moving the movable chuck. In the 
stage, the outside diameters of the preform before and 
after drawing are measured. Deviations of these meas-
ured values from previously set reference values are 
used to control the drawing speed of the preform, the 
amount of heat generated by the burner, or the feeding 
speed of the burner relative to the preform. 
[0008] Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 11, no. 167, 28 
May 1986 &amp; JP 61 295 250 A describe a similar automatic 
drawing device for a preform of an optical fiber, wherein 
only one value of the outside diameter is measured and 
a target value of the outside diameter in the midway or 
just after drawing of the preform is set in an operation 
control. The difference between the measured value and 
the target value is used to control the heating power of 
the burner and the speed of a base carrying the burner 
and the diameter measuring device in the axial direction 
of the preform. 

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 

[0009] As stated, it is an object of the present invention 
to provide an optical fiber manufacture method and a 
preform manufacture method that can solve the problems 
outlined above. In particular, it is an object of the present 
invention to provide such methods that allow for manu-
facturing a glass rod of consistently high quality and with 
a smooth surface and correspondingly for manufacturing 
an optical fiber of high quality. This object of the present 
invention can be achieved by the combination of features 
described in the independent claim of the present inven-
tion. 
[0010] According to the present invention, a method 
of manufacturing a second perform for an optical fiber 
comprises heating a glass rod, which is a first preform 
for said optical fiber, and elongating said heated glass 
rod to generate the second preform, wherein said heating 
and the elongating speed are controlled based on the 
diameter of the glass rod which changes with the

progress of elongation of said glass rod, and is charac-
terized in that the method further comprises end-drawing 
said second preform to form an end-drawn region for 
drawing the optical fiber, and fire polishing said second 
preform after end-drawing, the location of the end-drawn 
region being detected by measuring the diameter at a 
plurality of locations covering the region comprising said 
end-drawn region along the axial direction of said second 
preform, a polishing range, where said glass rod is pol-
ished by a flame, being set in relation to the detected 
location of said end-drawn region, and the heating power 
of said flame being controlled based on the correspond-
ing diameter of the second preform for polishing said pol-
ishing range of said second preform by said flame. 
[0011] According to another aspect of the same inven-
tion, a corresponding method for manufacturing an opti-
cal fiber furthermore comprises heating and drawing said 
second perform to a filament-like form to generate said 
optical fiber.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 

[0013] The present invention will be explained using 
embodiments of the present invention. The following em-
bodiments however, do not limit the scope of the present 
invention described in the claims. Moreover, not all the 
features or their combinations described in the embodi-
ments are necessarily essential for the present invention. 
[0014] Although the present invention has been de-
scribed with reference to specific embodiments, the 
scope of the present invention is not limited to these em-
bodiments. Those skilled in the art can make various 
modifications and improvements to the embodiments of 
the present invention. It is clear from the appended claims 
that such modifications or improvements are also cov-
ered by the scope of the present invention. 
[0015] Fig. 3 shows a system of an optical fiber man-
ufacturing apparatus of the present invention. The sys-
tem of the optical fiber manufacturing apparatus of 
present invention comprises a glass base material gen-
erating apparatus 600 which generates a glass base ma-
terial 102 being a base material of an optical fiber; a glass 
base material dehydrating and sintering apparatus 700 
which dehydrates and sinters the glass base material 
102; a glass base material first elongating apparatus 900 
which elongates the glass base material 102 to generate 
a glass rod 106; a glass rod transportation device 380 
which transports the glass rod 106; a glass rod second 
elongating apparatus 111 which elongates the glass rod 
106 a second time to generate a preform 107; and a 
preform drawing apparatus 500 which draws the preform 
107 to generate an optical fiber. 
[0016] Fig. 4 shows an optical fiber manufacturing 
method of the present invention. The glass base material 
102 is generated by the glass base material generating 
apparatus 600 using the VAD method, vapor-phase axial 
deposition method, or the like (S200). The glass base 
material 102 is then dehydrated within a chlorine gas 
atmosphere and sintered within an inert-gas atmosphere 
by the glass base material dehydrating and sintering ap-
paratus 700 (S202). 
[0017] The diameter of the glass base material 102 is 
normally 110 mm to 200 mm, compared to a diameter of 
30 mm to 80 mm which is most practical for drawing to 
an optical fiber. Therefore, the dehydrated and sintered 
glass base material 102 is elongated firstly by the glass 
base material first elongating apparatus 900 to produce 
a glass rod 106 (S204). The glass rod 106 has a diameter 
3 mm to 5 mm larger than the diameter convenient for 
drawing to an optical fiber, which is from 30 mm to 80mm. 
[0018] The glass rod 106 is transported by the glass 

rod transportation device 380 (S205). The glass rod 106 
is then heated and elongated by the glass rod second 
elongating apparatus 111 to a prescribed diameter, thus 
producing a preform 107 (S206). The preform 107 is heat-
ed and drawn to a filament-like form by the preform draw-
ing apparatus 500 to produce an optical fiber (S210). 
[0019] Fig. 5 shows a configuration of a glass base 
material first elongating apparatus 900. The glass base 
material first elongating apparatus 900 comprises a first 
elongating device 402 which heats and elongates the 
glass base material 102 and a glass rod fusing apparatus 
370 which fusing the glass rod 106. The first elongating 
device 402 has a elongating furnace 130, which has a 
heating furnace 100, and a hanging mechanism 134 
which is provided above the elongating furnace 130. The 
hanging mechanism 134 supplies the glass base material 
102 to the inside of the elongating furnace 130 at a pre-
scribed speed. 
[0020] The first elongating device 402 further has an 
elongating mechanism 140 which is provided under the 
elongating furnace 130 to hold the glass rod 106 of re-
duced diameter and to pull the glass rod 106 at a pre-
scribed speed. The hanging mechanism 134 has a base 
material fix unit 136 that holds the glass base material 
102. The elongating mechanism 140 has an elongating 
chuck 142 that holds the glass rod 106. 
The glass rod fusing apparatus 370 has a burner 176, a 
rotating table 210, a timing belt 214, a motor 212, a sup-
porting leg 208, a burner stand 216, an elongating device 
206, and an elongating fusion chuck 218. 
[0021] The glass base material 102 is installed on the 
base material fix unit 136, and sent into the heating fur-
nace 100 at a prescribed speed. The glass base material 
102 heated by the heating furnace 100 is held and pulled 
by the elongating chuck 142 to reduce the diameter thus 
producing a glass rod 106. The glass rod 106 is pulled 
by the elongating device 206 at a speed which is suitable 
for the diameter to be obtained, so that the glass base 
material 102 is elongated to the desired diameter. At this 
time, the diameter of the glass rod 106 is measured by 
a diameter measuring device 152. The feeder 204, heat-
ing furnace 100, and elongating device 206 are controlled 
based on this measurement in order to elongate the glass 
rod 106 to the desired diameter. 
[0022] The glass rod 106, which has been elongated 
to a prescribed diameter and length, is fused by the burn-
er 176 at the part that does not include the bubble or 
does not include the bubble of which diameter is sub-
stantially 0.3 mm or above. A flame of oxygen and hy-
drogen is a desirable heating means of the burner 176. 
A gas flame of based on hydrocarbon fuels such as pro-
pane and oxygen can also be used for the burner 176. 
[0023] The burner 176 is installed on the rotating table 
210 via the supporting leg 208. The rotating table is ro-
tated by a driving device such as motor 212 via the timing 
belt 214. The rotating table 210 is installed on the burner 
stand 216. The glass rod fusing apparatus 370 fuses the 
glass rod 106 by heating the glass rod 106 with the ro-

tating the burner 176 and elongates the glass rod 106 
using the elongating fusion chuck 218 with a prescribed 
speed and pull strength. 
[0024] Fig. 6 shows a first elongating device 402 which 
holds a standard rod 138 by a material fix unit 136 to 
adjust the axis for elongating a glass base material 102. 
The hanging mechanism 134 has a mechanism not 
shown in the figure, that adjusts the vertical inclination 
of the base material fix unit 136. The elongating mecha-
nism 140 has a mechanism, also not shown in the figure, 
that adjusts the vertical inclination of the elongating chuck 
142. The elongating mechanism 140 further has a mech-
anism, again not shown in the figure, that adjusts the 
position of the elongating mechanism 140 within the hor-
izontal phase in the directions back and forth and left and 
right. 
[0025] Fig. 7 shows a detailed flow chart of a glass 
base material first elongating (S204) shown in Fig. 4. The 
glass base material first elongating (S204) has a process 
to adjust the elongating axis of the first elongating device 
402. First, a metal or ceramic rod is prepared as a stand-
ard rod 138. The straightness of the standard rod 138 
should be guaranteed. The standard rod 138 usually has 
a length of a glass base material 102 and dummy rod 
that is welded onto the glass base material 102. The 
straightness of the axis of the standard rod 138 is guar-
anteed along the full length. 
[0026] As shown in fig. 6, the standard rod 138 is held 
by the base material fix unit 136 of the hanging mecha-
nism 134 (S110). Then, the inclination A of the hanging 
mechanism 134 is adjusted so that the direction of the 
standard rod 138 matches with the vertical direction 
(S112). Following this, the standard rod 138 is removed 
from the base material fix unit 136 after finishing the ad-
justment (S114). 
[0027] Fig. 8 shows the first elongating device 402 that 
holds the standard rod 138 by the elongating chuck 142. 
The standard rod 138 is held by the elongating chuck 
142 of the elongating mechanism 140 (Fig. 7, S116), 
Then the inclination B of the elongating mechanism 140 
is adjusted so that the direction of the standard rod 138 
matches with the vertical direction (Fig. 7, S118). At this 
time, it is desirable that the elongating chuck 142 main-
tains the approximate center of longitudinal direction of 
the standard rod 138. The procedure for adjusting the 
hanging mechamechanism 134 and the elongating 
mechanism 140 can be reversible. The elongating mech-
anism 140 can be adjusted first, and then the hanging 
mechanism 134 can be adjusted. 
[0028] Fig. 9 shows the first elongating device 402, 
which holds the standard rod 138 by both the hanging 
mechanism 134 and the elongating mechanism 140. Af-
ter finishing the adjustment of the hanging mechanism 
134 and the elongating mechanism 140, by holding the 
standard rod 138 by the base material fix unit 136, the 
lower end of the standard rod 138 is held by the elongat-
ing chuck 142 (Fig. 7, S120). Then, the horizontal direc-
tion position C of the elongating mechanism 140 or the 

horizontal direction position C of the hanging mechanism 
134 is adjusted so that the difference in horizontal direc-
tion between the vertical axis and the standard rod 138 
is less than 0.5 mm per 1 m length (Fig. 7, S122). 
[0029] Following this, a glass rod 106 is generated by 
elongating the glass base material 102 using the first 
elongating device 402, the elongating axis of which is 
adjusted (Fig. 7, S124). Finally, the glass rod 106 is fused 
by the glass rod fusing apparatus 370 (Fig. 7, S126). 
[0030] Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 show examples that use 
elongating rollers 144a and 144b on the elongating 
mechanism 140 instead of the elongating chuck 142. To 
adjust the vertical inclination of the axis connecting the 
hanging mechanism 134 and the elongating mechanism 
140 in the case of using the elongating rollers 144a and 
144b, the following method is adopted. The standard rod 
138 is held by the elongating rollers 144a and 144b as 
opposed to the holding of the standard rod 138 by the 
elongating chuck 142 (Fig. 7, S116). 
[0031] Following this, the inclination of the elongating 
mechanism 140 is adjusted by adjusting the horizontal 
inclination of the line F. The line F connects the two ro-
tation axis between the elongating rollers 144a and 144b. 
After the adjustment of the inclination of the elongating 
mechanism 140 (Fig. 7, S118), the elongating rollers 
144a and 144b can hold the standard rod 138 vertically. 
[0032] Next, as shown in Fig. 11, the standard rod 138 
is held by the base material fix unit 136 of the hanging 
mechanism 134 and the elongating rollers 144a and 144b 
of the elongating mechanism 140 at the step correspond-
ing to holding the standard rod 138 by the base material 
fix unit 136 and the elongating chuck 142 (Fig. 7, S120). 
Then, the vertical inclination E of the axis which connects 
the hanging mechanism 134 and elongating mechanism 
140 is adjusted. This adjustment is made either by ad-
justing the position of the elongating mechanism 140 in 
the horizontal direction or adjusting the position of the 
hanging mechanism 134 in the horizontal direction at the 
step corresponding to adjustment of the horizontal direc-
tion position of the hanging mechanism 134 and the elon-
gating mechanism 140 (Fig. 7, S122). 
[0033] The vertical inclination of the axis connecting 
the hanging mechanism 134 and elongating mechanism 
140 can be readily adjusted using the adjusting method 
shown above. This method is suitable not only for elon-
gating the straight glass base material 102 without any 
gap between the dummy rod and the glass base material 
102, but also for elongating a glass base material 102 
with some bending, to obtain a glass rod 106 with reduced 
diameter within a desired range of straightness. This is 
possible, provided the glass base material 102 is welded 
onto the dummy rod without a gap between the axis of 
the glass base material 102 and the dummy rod. 
[0034] The first elongating device 402 can adjust the 
vertical inclination of the elongating axis accurately for 
the methods of holding the glass base material 102 by 
either the hanging mechanism 134, the elongating mech-
anism 140 or by both the hanging mechanism 134 and

the elongating mechanism 140. Therefore, the bending 
moment, which causes bending on the heat softened re-
gion of the glass base material 102 can be decreased. 
Bending is generated by the weight of the elongated glass 
base material 102 as it bears on the elongating mecha-
nism 140. The glass base material 102 can therefore be 
elongated within a desired range of straightness without 
causing a gap between the axis of the glass base material 
102 and the dummy rod. 
[0035] Fig. 12 shows the glass base material 102, the 
bending degree of which is measured. The glass base 
material 102 is elongated by the first elongating device 
402, the vertical inclination of which is adjusted by the 
adjusting method shown above. Then, the degree of 
bending of the glass rod 106 is measured. First, the glass 
rod 106 is placed on two bearings 148 and 149, which 
are installed horizontally so that the line connecting the 
top of bearings 148 and 149 can be a standard line. Next, 
the maximum or minimum value of the height from the 
standard line is measured by scanning the measuring 
device 150 along the glass rod 106 using a device such 
as a dial gauge. 
[0036] Then, the glass rod 106 is rotated 180 degrees, 
and the maximum and minimum value of the height from 
the standard line is measured in the same way. The max-
imum value of the difference between the first measured 
maximum value and the next measured minimum value 
or the difference of the first measured minimum value 
and the next measured maximum value is set as "2h". 
The value that divides the "h" by the length L1, which is 
a distance between two bearings 148 and 149, repre-
sents the straightness of the glass rod 106 per unit of 
length. 
[0037] 5 pieces of the straight glass base material 102 
without the gap of axis with dummy rod were elongated 
by the first elongating device 402 with an adjusted elon-
gating axis to produce 5 of glass rod 106. The straight-
ness of each of the glass rods 106 was measured by the 
method shown in Fig. 12. The "h" of the glass rods 106 
were all within 0.5 mm. Next, the glass rods 106 were 
elongated by the first elongating device 402 without ad-
justment of the elongating axis. An average of 90 percent 
of the glass rods 106 were bent which indicates that the 
glass rod 106 should be corrected through adjustment 
of the elongating axis. 
[0038] Fig. 13 shows a mechanism by which the first 
elongating device 402 controls the speed of rotation of 
the elongating rollers 144a and 144b. The first elongating 
device 402 controls the rotation speed of each of the 
elongating rollers 144a and 144b respectively. The glass 
base material 102 is hung by the base material fix unit 
136 of the first elongating device 402 and sent to the 
heating furnace (not shown in the figure) at a prescribed 
speed. The glass rod 106, which is heated and softened 
by the heating furnace, is taken by the pair of elongating 
rollers 144a and 144b. 
[0039] The center position of the heat softened region 
of the glass base material 102 is obtained by measuring 

the diameter of the heat softened region of the glass base 
material 102 using the diameter measuring device 152. 
At the same time the center position of the measured 
diameter is calculated. A laser beam transmission type 
diameter measuring device is used as the diameter 
measuring device 152. The laser beam is irradiated onto 
the heat softened region of the glass base material 
102through the window provided on the lower part of the 
heater in the heating furnace. 
[0040] The measured diameter is input to the diameter 
control unit 156, and the difference between the target 
diameter value and the measured diameter is calculated. 
The rotation speed of the elongating roller 144a is con-
trolled based on the calculated difference of the diameter. 
Then, the information on the center position of the heat 
softened region is input to the position control unit 158. 
[0041] The position control unit 158 calculates the 
amount of deviation between the center position of the 
heat softened region and the elongating axis 154 of the 
first elongating device 402. The position control unit 158 
further calculates the correction value of the rotation 
speed, which can reduce the deviation between the cent-
er position of heat softened region and the elongating 
axis 154 to virtually zero. Then, the position control unit 
158 controls the rotation speed of the elongating roller 
144b based on the addition of the correction value and 
the rotation speed of the elongating roller 144a. 
[0042] Fig. 14 shows a relationship between the 
amount of deviation between the center position of the 
heat softened region of the glass base material 102 and 
the elongating axis 154, and the degree of bend caused 
in the glass rod 106. The larger the amount of deviation 
between the center position of the heat softened region 
of the glass base material 102 and elongated axis 154, 
the larger the resultant bend in the glass rod 106. 
[0043] When the amount of deviation is large, the heat-
resistant members on the surface of the elongating rollers 
144a and 144b are deformed. The shapes of the elon-
gating rollers 144a and 144b become slightly different to 
each other. The result is the rotation speeds of the sur-
faces of the elongating rollers 144a and 144b are different 
to each other. Since the deformation of the surface of the 
elongating rollers 144a and 144b is one of the causes of 
the bending of the glass rod 106, the bend of the glass 
rod 106 can be reduced by controlling the rotation speed 
of each of the elongating rollers 144a and 144b respec-
tively. 
[0044] The surfaces of the elongating rollers 144a and 
144b are formed from a heat-resistant material such as 
non-asbestos or asbestos. These materials are heat re-
sistant and flexible, so that the elongating rollers 144a 
and 144b can easily elongate the glass rod 106 at high 
temperatures. The surface of the elongating rollers 144a 
and 144b that come into contact with the glass rod 106 
are gradually deformed by the high temperature and 
pinching force or friction force of the glass rod 106. Be-
cause the deformation of the elongating rollers 144a and 
144b is slightly different to each other, the rotation speed

of the surfaces of the elongating rollers 144a and 144b 
also differs. 
[0045] Fig. 15 shows deformation of the surfaces of 
the elongating rollers 144a and 144b. The outside shape 
of the elongating roller 144a and the elongating roller 
144b is different. The number of batches is the number 
of glass base materials 102 which were elongated. As 
the number of batches is increased, the deformation and 
abrasion is progressed. The result is, the amount of elon-
gation becomes different between the elongating rollers 
144a and 144b, which causes fluctuation in the position 
of the heat softened region of the glass base material 
102 which in turn causes bending of the glass rod 106. 
[0046] Fig. 16 shows displacement of the center posi-
tion of the heated region of the metal pipe when the metal 
pipe is taken by the elongating rollers 144a and 144b at 
batch number 300 shown in Fig. 15. The vertical axis 
shows the displacement of the center position of the heat-
ed region of the metal pipe, and the horizontal axis shows 
time. The curve A shows the fluctuation of the amount of 
deviation in the direction of rotation of the elongating roll-
ers 144a and 144b. The curve A shows that the displace-
ment fluctuates largely during a single rotation of the elon-
gating rollers 144a and 144b. The curve B shows that 
the fluctuation of displacement is quite small for the axis 
direction of the elongating rollers 144a and 144b. 
[0047] Fig. 17 shows displacement of the center posi-
tion of the heat softened region by the first elongating 
device 402 of the embodiment. The vertical axis shows 
the displacement of the center position of the heat sof-
tened region of the glass base material 102, and the hor-
izontal axis shows the time from the start of the elonga-
tion. The displacement of the heat softened region is con-
trolled and maintained at a small level after 1500 seconds 
from the start of the elongation. Therefore, a glass rod 
106 without a substantial bend can be manufactured by 
controlling the rotation speed of the each of the elongat-
ing rollers 144a and 144b respectively. This allows the 
center position of the heat softened region to be main-
tained at a relatively constant point. 

(Comparative Example) 

[0048] Fig. 18 shows fluctuation of the center position 
of the heat softened region when the rotation speed of 
the elongating rollers 144a and 144b are controlled at 
the same rotation speed as each other. The vertical axis 
shows the displacement of the center position of the heat 
softened region of the glass base material 102, and the 
horizontal axis shows the time from the start of the elon-
gation. 
[0049] A glass rod 106 having a prescribed diameter 
was manufactured by measuring the diameter of the heat 
softened region of the glass base material 102 using the 
same diameter measuring device 152 in Fig. 17. The 
rotating speeds of the elongating rollers 144a and 144b 
were controlled at the same rotation speed as each other. 
The fluctuation of the center position of the heat softened 

region was large so that a bend requiring correction was 
caused on the elongated glass rod 106. 
[0050] Fig. 19 shows another embodiment of the burn-
er 176 used in the glass rod fusing apparatus 370 shown 
in Fig. 5. A ring burner 176 has a hydrogen gas supply 
pipe 190 and a ring-type gas inlet 194, which are con-
nected to an oxygen gas supply pipe 192. The cooling 
pipe 196, which is connected to the cooling water supply 
pipe 198 and cooling water drainage pipe 200, is provided 
on the outer area of the ring burner 176. The ring-type 
gas inlet 194 can be a single layer that ejects a mix of 
hydrogen gas and oxygen gas. The ring-type gas inlet 
194 can also be multiple or triple layered which eject the 
hydrogen gas from the upper and lower layers and oxy-
gen gas from the middle layer. 
[0051] The glass rod 106 is set inside the ring of the 
ring burner 176, after which the hydrogen and oxygen 
gases are supplied to the ring burner 176 and ignited. 
The surface of the glass rod 106 is fused by the flame 
178. The ring burner 178 can heat the glass rod 106 
efficiently so that it is unnecessary to over heat the glass 
rod 106. Therefore, the opaque region on the surface of 
the glass, generated when glass is heated to tempera-
tures higher than 2000°C, cannot be seen on the fused 
surface of the glass rod 106. 
[0052] According to the embodiments shown above, 
the glass rod 106 was fused. The glass base material 
102 with a diameter of 120 mm was heated by the ring 
burner 176 for ten minutes. Hydrogen gas was supplied 
to the ring burner 176 at a rate of 300 L/ minute and ox-
ygen gas at 120 L/ minute. The glass rod 106 was fused 
by elongation when the glass rod 106 was melted. The 
fused surface of the glass rod 106 was shaped into a 
circular cone. The color of the surface of the glass rod 
106 was transparent. 
[0053] Fig. 20 shows a configuration of a glass rod 
transportation device 380. The glass rod transportation 
device 380 is used for transporting the glass rod 106 
generated by the first elongating device 402. The glass 
rod 106 is held by the movable holding element 245 and 
the fixed holding element 246 installed on the air cylinder 
storage box 244. When the air cylinder (not shown in the 
figure) provided inside the air cylinder storage box 244 
is driven, the movable holding element 245 moves toward 
the fixed holding element 246 thereby holding the glass 
rod 106. 
[0054] The force with which the movable holding ele-
ment 245 pushes the fixed holding element 246 can be 
modified by modifying the air pressure which flows into 
the air cylinder. The air pressure of the air cylinder can 
be modified by operating a switch during the transporta-
tion of the glass rod 106. The switch is provided on the 
operating switch box 248. 
[0055] The present embodiment has a second level of 
pushing force for pushing the movable holding element 
245 to the fixed holding element 246. This is achieved 
by adjusting the air pressure which flows into the air cyl-
inder to one of two possible levels. For example, the weak

side of the pushing force, which pushes the movable 
holding element 245 to the fixed holding element 246, is 
the first holding force, and the strong side of the pushing 
force is second holding force. The first holding force is 
set to 0.5 kg, and the second holding force is set to 80 kg. 
[0056] The air pressure adjustment of the air cylinder 
does not have to have only two levels of adjustment. The 
air pressure adjustment can be a multiple level adjusting 
type which adjusts to more than three levels of air pres-
sure or the continuous adjustment type that provides a 
gradual rather than stepped level change. A rotary actu-
ator 250 rotates the glass rod 106 from the vertical con-
dition to the horizontal condition by rotating the movable 
holding element 245 and the fixed holding element 246 
through the air cylinder storage box 244. A holding flame 
252 holds the glass rod transportation device 380 by con-
necting the glass rod transportation device 380 to the 
first elongating device 402. A handle 254 is used for op-
erating the glass rod transportation device 380. A rotation 
axis 256 rotates the air cylinder storage box 244. 
[0057] Fig. 21 shows a storage container 224 of the 
first elongating device 402. The storage container 224 
has a saucer 260, a strut 262, a pair of holding members 
234a and 234b which hold the glass rod 106, and a pair 
of holding members 236a and 236b which are provided 
under the holding members 234a and 234b. The shapes 
of the holding members 234a, 234b, 236a, and 236b are 
substantially semicircle, which is desirable to securely 
hold the glass rod 106 inside the storage container 224. 
Together, each of the pair of holding members 234a and 
234b and holding members 236a and 236b form circle 
shaped holding members. 
[0058] One end of each of the holding members 234a 
and 234b and the holding member 236a and 236b is pin 
connected to strut 262. The other end of each is connect-
ed to the corresponding pair of holding members by a 
pin 257 or a pin 258. The holding members 234a and 
234b are connected by the pin 257, and the holding mem-
bers 236a and 236b are connected by the pin 258. The 
height of the strut 262 is 1,550 mm. The inside diameter 
of the saucer 260 is 300 mm. Each of the inside diameters 
of the holding members are 180 mm, formed by the pair 
of holding members 234a and 234b and the pair of hold-
ing members 236a and 236b. 
[0059] In the case of receiving inside the storage con-
tainer 224, a glass rod 106with an outside diameter of 
80 mm, 4, the angle of inclination α between the strut 
262 and the glass rod 106 in the front and rear direction 
can range from -3.1°to +8.1°. The angle of inclination β 
between the glass rod 106 and the strut 262 in the left 
and right directions can range from -5.9° to +5.9°. Here, 
The angle of inclination is a limited value, and the glass 
rod 106 can be received inside the storage container 224 
in various angles within this limited value. The glass rod 
106 is in a various angles inside the storage container 
224. 
[0060] Fig. 22 shows a movement of the glass rod 
transportation device 380 when transporting the glass 

rod 106. The glass rod 106 inside of the storage container 
224 is held by the movable holding element 245 and fixed 
holding element 246 with the first holding force (b). Then, 
the glass rod 106 is moved so that the glass rod 106 
stands vertical to the ground within the holding member 
234a and 234b (C). Because the first holding force is very 
weak, the movable holding element 245 will be opened 
when a force larger than the first holding force is applied 
to the movable holding element 245 during movement of 
the glass rod 106. Moreover, the friction force acted be-
tween the movable holding element 245 and glass rod 
106 and between the fixed holding element 246 and glass 
rod 106 is very small compared to the weight of the glass 
rod 106. Therefore, glass rod cannot be lifted by raising 
the glass rod transportation device 380, which holds the 
glass rod 106 by the first holding force. 
[0061] After confirming that the glass rod 106 stands 
vertical, the holding force of the glass rod transportation 
device 380 is changed to the second holding force (d). 
Following this, the pins 257 and 258 are removed, and 
each of the holding members 234a and 234b and the 
holding member 236a and 236b are opened. Next, the 
glass rod transportation device 380 takes the glass rod 
106 out of the storage container 224 for transportation. 
The glass rod 106 taken from the storage container 224 
is rotated to a horizontal position and placed on the keep-
ing place. During horizontal placement of the glass rod 
106 on the keeping place, air pressure larger than a con-
stant value is applied to the air cylinder to raise and lower 
the glass rod transportation device 380. Therefore, the 
weight of the glass rod transportation device 380 is not 
applied to the glass rod 106 which prevents damage to 
the glass rod. 
[0062] Fig. 23 shows an another embodiment of the 
glass rod transportation device 380. The glass rod trans-
portation device 380 of this embodiment has two rotation 
mechanisms A and B. Each of the rotation mechanisms 
A and B has a rotary actuator. The rotation mechanism 
A rotates the glass rod 106 by rotating a rotation axis 256 
through the rotary actuator 250. The rotation mechanism 
B moves the glass rod 106 up and down or left and right 
through the coupling axis 266 by rotating a rotation axis 
268 through the rotary actuator 264. The rotation axis 
268 lies at right angles to the rotation axis 256 horizontally 
or vertically. 
[0063] Fig. 24 shows the movement of the glass rod 
transportation device 380 shown in Fig. 23 when the 
glass rod transportation device 380 transports the glass 
rod 106. Fig. 24 (a) shows a plan view of the glass rod 
transportation device 380, which holds the glass rod 106. 
Fig. 24 (b) shows the cross sectional view of the glass 
rod transportation device 380, which transports the glass 
rod 106 to the V block 240. As shown in Fig. 24 (a), the 
movable holding elements 245 and 246, which hold the 
glass rod 106 vertically, are rotated from the vertical to 
horizontal position by operating the rotary actuator 250. 
Next, as shown in Fig. 24 (b), the movable holding ele-
ment 245 and the fixed holding element 246 are rotated

downward by activating the rotary actuator 264. 
[0064] The direction of opening and closing of the mov-
able holding element 245 changes from a vertical direc-
tion to horizontal direction by activating the rotary actu-
ator 264. Therefore, the movable holding element 245 
and the fixed holding element 246 can release upward 
after placing the glass rod 106 on the V block 240 by 
opening the movable holding element 245. By including 
not only the rotation mechanism A, which rotates the 
glass rod 106 from a vertical to horizontal position, but 
also the rotation mechanism B, which has another rota-
tion axis 268 that lies at right angles to the rotation axis 
256, the transportation efficiency of the glass rod 106 is 
increased. 
[0065] Fig. 25 shows a configuration of a glass rod 
second elongating apparatus 111 of the present inven-
tion. The glass rod second elongating apparatus 111 
comprises a mounting 112, a fixed chuck 118, a movable 
chuck 119, a heating source 122, a mass flow controller 
278, tail stocks 114 and 116, a tail stock driving motor 
275, a tail stock driving encoder 273, a diameter meas-
urement device 124, a moving stand 120, a sliding screw 
270, a moving stand motor 274, a moving stand encoder 
272, a chain 276, and a control unit 280. 
[0066] The fixed chuck 118 and the movable chuck 
119 hold the glass rod 106 which has been weld at both 
ends to a dummy rod 108. The heating source 122 heats 
the glass rod 106, which is held by the fixed chuck 118 
and movable chuck 119. The mass flow controller 278 
adjusts the amount of gas supplied to the heating source 
122. The tail stock 116 elongates the glass rod 106 by 
moving the movable chuck 119. The tail stock driving 
motor 275 drives the tail stock 116. The tail stock driving 
encoder 273 detects the amount of the rotation and con-
trols the speed of the tail stock driving motor 275. The 
moving distance of the tail stock 116 can be assessed 
from the amount of the rotation of the tail stock driving 
motor 275 detected by the tail stock driving encoder 273. 
[0067] The diameter measurement device 124 meas-
ures the diameter of the glass rod 106 corresponding to 
the position along the axial direction of the glass rod 106. 
The heating source 122 and the diameter measurement 
device 124 are provided on the moving stand 120. The 
moving stand 120 moves the heating source 122 and 
diameter measurement device 124. The moving stand 
120 is provided on the mounting 112. The moving stand 
120 can move along the sliding screw 270, which is in-
stalled parallel to the axis that connects the fixed chuck 
118 and movable chuck 119. The moving stand 120 is 
driven by the moving stand motor 274 through the sliding 
screw 270 and the chain 276. The moving stand encoder 
272 controls the speed of the moving stand motor 274. 
[0068] The control unit 280 controls the moving dis-
tance of the heating source 122 by controlling the moving 
stand encoder 272, the moving stand motor 274, the 
chain 276, the sliding screw 270 and the moving stand 
120. The control unit 280 controls the amount of gas pro-
vided to the heating source 122 by controlling the mass 

flow controller 278. The control unit 280 controls the mov-
ing speed of the tail stock 116 by controlling the tail stock 
driving encoder 273 which controls the rotation speed of 
the tail stock driving motor 275. The control unit 280 con-
trols the elongating speed of the glass rod 106 by con-
trolling the moving speed of the tail stock 116. 
[0069] The tail stock 114 and 116, fixed chuck 118, 
movable chuck 119, tail stock driving motor 275, and tail 
stock driving encoder 273 constitute an elongating unit 
which elongates the glass rod 106. 
[0070] The data on the measured diameter and posi-
tion of measurement as measured by the diameter meas-
urement device 124, and the data on the changes in 
length of the glass rod 106 obtained from the moving 
distance of the tail stock 116 are input to control unit 280. 
The control unit 280 controls the heating condition based 
on input data by controlling factors such as moving dis-
tance of the heating source 122, the amount of gas pro-
vided to the heating source 122, and also controls the 
elongation speed of the tail stock 116 based on input 
data. 
[0071] Fig. 26 shows a detailed flow chart of the glass 
rod second elongating (S206) shown in Fig. 4. First, the 
dummy rods 108 are held by the fixed chuck 118 and the 
movable chuck 119. Following this, both ends of the glass 
rod 106 are welded to the dummy rods 108 (S146) so 
that the glass rod 106 is set on the glass rod second 
elongating apparatus 111. Next, a cut 284 of 3 mm depth 
is made around the connection of the glass rod 106 and 
the dummy rods 108 as a marker. 
[0072] The starting and finishing position of the diam-
eter measurement of the glass rod 106 and the target 
diameter are then set (S150). The diameter of the glass 
rod 106 is measured corresponding to the location along 
the axial direction of the glass rod 106 (S152). The elon-
gating speed at a plurality of locations along the axial 
direction of the glass rod 106 is set based on the meas-
ured diameter and the location corresponding to the 
measured diameter. The heating conditions including the 
amount of gas supplied to the heating source 122 and 
the moving distance of the heating source 122 are set 
based on the average value of the diameter of the glass 
rod (S153). The glass rod 106 is heated by the heating 
source 122 with a preset heating condition and elongated 
gradually by the tail stock 116, which moves with a preset 
elongating speed (S154). 
[0073] The location of the cut 284, which is provided 
around the connection of the glass rod 106 and the dum-
my rods 108, are then detected by the diameter meas-
urement device 124 in order to detect the location of both 
ends of the glass rod 106. The moving distance of the 
tail stock 116 is measured by the tail stock driving en-
coder 273 in order to measure changes in the length of 
the glass rod 106 along the axial direction. 
[0074] The diameter of the glass rod 106 is then meas-
ured at a position approximately 50 mm away from the 
cut 284 towards the center of the glass rod 106 (S156). 
The heating position of the heating source 122 is set

based on the position of the cut 284 and the changes in 
in length of the glass rod 106 along the axial direction. 
The amount of gas supplied to the heating source 122 is 
set based on the measured diameter. The moving speed 
of the tail stock 116 is also set based on the measured 
diameter (S157). The glass rod 106 is end-drawn which 
heats and elongates the glass rod 106 with a preset heat-
ing condition and elongating speed. The shape of the 
end of the glass rod 106 therefore becomes similar to a 
circular cone shape so that the diameter of end of the 
glass rod 106 reduced (S158). 
[0075] The position of the end-drawn part is then de-
tected by measuring the diameter of the end-drawn part 
and the part elongated by the end drawing at the corre-
sponding position. These measurements are undertaken 
by the diameter measurement device 124. The change 
in length of the glass rod 106 along the axial direction 
resulting from end drawing is measured by the tail stock 
driving encoder 273 (S160). The starting and finishing 
position of the fire polishing, which polishes the glass rod 
106 with fire, and the heating power of the fire are then 
set. This setting is based on the detected position of the 
end-drawn part and the change in length of the glass rod 
106 along the axial direction (S161). 
[0076] The position of starting and finishing the fire pol-
ishing is set based on the position of the cloud on the 
glass rod 106. A cloud is generated in a region that is 
heated strongly during the end drawing process. The 
glass rod 106 is fire polished by the heating source 122 
as per the preset fire condition from the set fire polishing 
starting position to the set fire polish finishing position 
(S162). After fire polishing, the shape of the glass rod 
106 is checked by measuring the finished diameter and 
length of the glass rod 106 (S164). The dummy rod 108 
is then removed from the glass rod 106 (S166). Finally, 
the glass rod 106 is surface treated to produce a preform 
107 (S168). 
[0077] As shown above, before each elongating 
(S154), end drawing (S158) and fire polishing (S162) 
process, the diameter is measured in the corresponding 
location along the axial direction of the glass rod 106. 
From this data, the heating condition and elongating 
speed for the next process can be accurately set. There-
fore, a glass rod 106 of consistently high quality can be 
manufactured. 
[0078] Fig. 27 shows an example which provides a 
cooling device 330 on the fixed chuck 118 and the mov-
able chuck 119 of the glass rod second elongating ap-
paratus 111. The cooling device 330 protects the fixed 
chuck 118 and movable chuck 119 from the radiant heat 
generated from the heating source 122. This is achieved 
by circulating cooling water around the fixed chuck 118 
and the movable chuck 119. The cooling device 330 uses 
a gas or liquid as a cooling medium. 
[0079] The deformation of the fixed chuck 118 and the 
movable chuck 119 can be controlled by providing the 
cooling device 330 on the fixed chuck 118 and the mov-
able chuck 119. This allows control of the degree of tem-

perature rise of the fixed chuck 118 and the movable 
chuck 119. Therefore, the accuracy of transfer of the driv-
ing force that rotates the glass rod 106 is maintained, 
and the heating of the glass rod 106 becomes more even. 
Therefore, fluctuation of the diameter of the glass rod 
106 decreases. 

(EXAMPLE) 

[0080] A glass rod 106 of 50 mm diameter and 1000 
mm length was fire polished by a fixed chuck 118 and 
movable chuck 119 that has a cooling device 330 and a 
heating source 122 shown in Fig. 27. Oxygen (O 2 ) of 150 
SLM and hydrogen (H 2 ) of 300 SLM are supplied to the 
heating source 122 as combustion gas. The glass rod 
106 is rotated at a speed of 15 rpm. The glass rod 106 
is fire polished by moving the heating source 122 relative 
to the glass rod 106 at a speed of approximately 20 
mm/min. 
[0081] Fig. 28 shows the temperature of the fixed 
chuck 118 and movable chuck 119 of the above example 
and the comparative example shown below. The vertical 
axis shows the temperature of the fixed chuck 118 and 
movable chuck 119, and the horizontal axis shows the 
processing time of the fire polishing. The temperature of 
the fixed chuck 118 and movable chuck 119 of the ex-
ample was maintained at a low temperature of about 
45°C. The resultant fluctuation of the driving force that 
rotates the glass rod 106 caused by the deformation of 
the fixed chuck 118 and movable chuck 119 was small. 
Therefore the fluctuation of the diameter of the fire pol-
ished glass rod 106 was only 0.02 %. 

(COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE) 

[0082] The glass rod 106 was fire polished under the 
same conditions as the above example except for the 
removal of the cooling device 330 from the fixed chuck 
118 and movable chuck 119 shown in Fig. 27. As shown 
in Fig. 28, the temperature of the fixed chuck 118 and 
movable chuck 119 reached approximately 100°C. The 
fixed chuck 118 and movable chuck 119 were deformed 
as a result, so the driving force that rotates the glass rod 
106 fluctuates. The fluctuation of the diameter of the glass 
rod 106 after fire polishing increased to 1.0 %, which is 
larger than the degree of fluctuation of the above exam-
ple. 
[0083] Fig. 29 shows a relationship between the dis-
tance between the heating source 122 and the diameter 
measurement device 124 and the percentage of the fluc-
tuation of the diameter of the glass rod 106. The fluctu-
ation rate (%) of the diameter of the glass rod 106 rep-
resents the (maximum value of the diameter of the glass 
rod 106 -minimum value of the diameter of the glass rod 
106) / (average diameter) x 100. 
[0084] The diameter measurement device 124 of the 
glass rod second elongating apparatus 111 shown in Fig. 
25 is provided on a location which is a constant distance,

from 10 mm to 50 mm, away from the heating source 
122. Therefore, the diameter of the glass rod 106 can be 
accurately measured allowing accurate control of the di-
ameter of the glass rod 106. 
[0085] When elongating the glass rod 106, the position 
of highest temperature in the glass rod 106 is slightly 
different to the position that the heating source 122 is 
heating because the heating source 122 is moving. The 
elongating speed per unit length becomes largest at the 
location where the temperature of the glass rod 106 is 
highest. 
[0086] It is desirable to control the heating power of 
the heating source 122 and the moving speed of the mov-
able chuck 119 based on the diameter at the position of 
the largest elongating speed and the target value of the 
diameter. The moving speed of the movable chuck 119 
is controlled based on the difference between the target 
value of the diameter and the diameter that is measured 
at the position that the elongating speed of the glass rod 
106 is largest. This can be done by providing the diameter 
measurement device 124 on a position that is a constant 
distance away from the heating source 122. 
[0087] The position, which is a constant distance away 
from the heating source 122, ranges from 10 mm to 50 
mm away from the position where the heating source 122 
is provided in the opposite direction to the moving direc-
tion of the heating source 122. Therefore, the diameter 
measurement device 124 is provided on a position 10 
mm to 50 mm away from the heating source 122 in the 
opposite direction of the moving direction of the heating 
source 122. 
[0088] If the heating source 122 used to heat the glass 
rod 106 is an oxygen hydrogen burner, the flow rate of 
the hydrogen gas supplied to the heating source 122 is 
set from 30 liters/ minute to 500 liters/ minute. The ratio 
of the flow rate of the hydrogen gas to the oxygen gas is 
set from 1.5 to 3.0. The moving speed of the heating 
source 122 is controlled within the limits of 2 mm/ minute 
and 65 mm/ minute. The heat quantity will be insufficient 
if the flow rate of the hydrogen gas is less than 30 liters/ 
minute, and the fuel will be wasted if the flow rate of the 
hydrogen gas is more than 500 liters/ minute. It is difficult 
to elongate the glass rod 106 if the ratio of the flow rate 
of the hydrogen gas to the oxygen gas is out of the range 
shown above because the heat quantity becomes insuf-
ficient. 
[0089] If the heating source 122 to heat the glass rod 
106 is a propane gas burner, the flow rate of the propane 
gas supplied to the heating source 122 is set from 1 liter/ 
minute to 15 liters/ minute. The ratio of the flow rate of 
the propane gas to the oxygen gas is set from 0.1 to 0.3. 
The moving speed of the heating source 122 is controlled 
within the limits of 2 mm/ minute and 65 mm/ minute. The 
heat quantity will be insufficient if the flow rate of the 
propane gas is less than 1 liter/ minute, and the fuel will 
be wasted if the flow rate of the propane gas is more than 
15 liters/ minute. Furthermore, it is difficult to elongate the 
glass rod 106 if the ratio of the flow rates of the propane 

gas to oxygen gas is out of the range shown above be-
cause the heat quantity becomes insufficient. The mov-
ing speed of the heating source 122 would preferably be 
controlled within the limit of 2 mm/ minute and 65 mm/ 
minute. It takes too much time elongating the glass rod 
106 if the moving speed of the heating source 122 is 
below 2 mm/ minute. Alternatively, it is difficult to elongate 
the glass rod 106 if the moving speed of the heating 
source 122 is more than 65 mm/ minute because the 
speed is too fast to heat the glass rod 106 to its core. 

(EXAMPLE 1) 

[0090] The elongation of the glass rod 106 was begun 
by setting the distance between the heating source 122 
and the diameter measurement device 124 as 15 mm. 
During the elongation of the glass rod 106, the moving 
speed of the heating source 122 and the tail stock 116 
were controlled based on the difference between the 
measured diameter of the glass rod 106 and the target 
diameter. The burning conditions of the heating source 
122 were set including the flow rate of the hydrogen gas 
at 224 liters/ minute, the ratio of the flow rate of the hy-
drogen to oxygen as 2.5, and the moving speed of the 
heating source 122 as 11 mm/ minute. The fluctuation 
rate of the diameter of the glass rod 106 after the elon-
gating process was 0.9 %. 

(EXAMPLE 2) 

[0091] The distance between the heating source 122 
and the diameter measurement device 124 was set to 
40 mm. The flow rate of the hydrogen gas was set to 199 
liters/ minute. The ratio of the flow rate of the hydrogen 
to oxygen was set to 2.5. The moving speed of the heating 
source 122 was set to 13 mm/ minute. The fluctuation 
rate of the diameter of the glass rod 106 after the elon-
gating process was 0.6 %. 

(COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1) 

[0092] The distance between the heating source 122 
and the diameter measurement device 124 was set to 5 
mm. The flow rate of the hydrogen gas was set to 209 
liters/ minute. The ratio of the flow rate of the hydrogen 
to oxygen was set to 2.5. The moving speed of the heating 
source 122 was set to 12 mm/ minute. Because the dis-
tance between the heating source 122 and the diameter 
measurement device 124 was too close, the fluctuation 
rate of the diameter of the glass rod 106 after the elon-
gating process was 3.7 %. This is larger than the fluctu-
ation rate of example 1 and example 2 above. 

(COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2) 

[0093] The distance between the heating source 122 
and the diameter measurement device 124 was set to 
60 mm.

[0094] The flow rate of the hydrogen gas was set to 
237 liters/ minute. The ratio of the flow rate of the hydro-
gen to oxygen was set to 2.5. The moving speed of the 
heating source 122 was set to 10 mm/ minute. Because 
the distance between the heating source 122 and the 
diameter measurement device 124 was too far, the fluc-
tuation rate of the diameter of the glass rod 106 after the 
elongating process was 2.5 %. This fluctuation rate is 
larger than the fluctuation rate of example 1 and example 
2 above. 

(COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 3) 

[0095] The distance between the heating source 122 
and the diameter measurement device 124 was set to 
15 mm. The flow rate of the hydrogen gas was set to 215 
liters/ minute. The ratio of the flow rate of the hydrogen 
to oxygen was set to 1.0. The moving speed of the heating 
source 122 was set to 12 mm/ minute. Because the ratio 
of the flow rate of the hydrogen to oxygen was 1.0, which 
was smaller than the recommended 1.5 minimum, the 
glass rod 106 could not be elongated. 

(COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 4) 

[0096] The distance between the heating source 122 
and the diameter measurement device 124 was set to 
15 mm. The flow rate of the hydrogen gas was set to 195 
liters/ minute. The ratio of the flow rate of the hydrogen 
to oxygen was set to 4.0. The moving speed of the heating 
source 122 was set to 13 mm/ minute. Because the ratio 
of the flow rate of the hydrogen to oxygen was 4.0, which 
was larger than the recommended 3.0 maximum, the 
glass rod 106 could not be elongated. 

(COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 5) 

[0097] The distance between the heating source 122 
and the diameter measurement device 124 was set to 
15 mm. The flow rate of the hydrogen gas was set to 204 
liters/ minute. The ratio of the flow rate of the hydrogen 
to oxygen was set to 2.5. The moving speed of the heating 
source 122 was set to 70 mm/ minute. Because the mov-
ing speed of the heating source 122 was 70 mm/ minute, 
which was larger than the 65 mm/ minute recommended 
maximum speed, the glass rod 106 could not be elon-
gated. 
[0098] Fig. 30 shows a glass rod second elongating 
apparatus 111 which has a configuration providing a ten-
sile stress measurement device 282 on the glass rod 
second elongating apparatus 111 shown in Fig. 25. The 
glass rod second elongating apparatus 111 has a tensile 
stress measurement device 282, which measures the 
tensile stress applied to the glass rod 106, on the movable 
chuck 119. 
[0099] The glass rod second elongating apparatus 111 
can detect the position of the heating source 122 on the 
moving stand 120 using the moving stand encoder 272. 

The tensile stress measurement device 282 is connected 
to a control unit 280. The control unit 280 controls the 
moving speed of the tail stock 116 based on the tensile 
stress of the glass rod 106, provided from the tensile 
stress measurement device 282. This is undertaken until 
the moving distance of the heating source 122 reaches 
a prescribed distance. 
[0100] Fig. 31 shows a detailed flow chart of the elon-
gating (S154) shown in the Fig. 26. First, the glass rod 
106 is pre-heated until the prescribed region of the glass 
rod 106 is melted and softened by the heating source 
122. This will allow elongation of the glass rod 106 (s132). 
Next, the heating source 122, which is provided on the 
moving stand 120, is moved via the moving stand 120. 
The moving speed of the heating source 122 would ide-
ally be as slow as possible at the early stage of the elon-
gation so that the fluctuation of the diameter of the glass 
rod 106 can be reduced. The movement of the heating 
source 122 would also be a constant speed. The amount 
of gas supplied to the heating source 122 can be con-
stant. 
[0101] Next, the moving speed of the tail stock 116 is 
controlled so that the tensile stress of the glass rod 106 
measured by the tensile stress measurement device 282 
lies within substantially 80 % to 110 % of the average 
value of the tensile stress at the steady state (S136). The 
steady state will be explained below. The moving speed 
of the tail stock 116, which was originally set based on 
the diameter at a plurality of locations of the glass rod 
106 along the axial direction, is re-set based on the tensile 
stress of the glass rod 106. The glass rod 106 is elongated 
by the tensile stress load shown above until the heating 
source moves substantially 50 mm to 150 mm (S138). 
[0102] If the control unit 280 detects that the heating 
source 122 has moved substantially from 50 mm to 150 
mm (S138), the moving speed of the tail stock 116 chang-
es to the speed at the steady state, which will be ex-
plained below. This is done by controlling the tail stock 
driving encoder 273 (S140). The diameter measurement 
device 124 measures the diameter of the glass rod 106 
during the elongation of the glass rod 106 (S142). The 
elongation of the glass rod 106 is finished when the glass 
rod 106 is elongated to the desired diameter and length 
(S144). 
[0103] The speed at the steady state is the speed 
where the material balance before the elongation and 
after the elongation is balanced. Here, the original diam-
eter of the glass rod 106 before the elongation is repre-
sented as D 1 , the target diameter to be obtained as D 2 , 
the moving speed of the heating source 122 as V 1 , and 
the speed of the elongation of the glass rod 106 as V 2 . 
[0104] For example, assume that the elongation takes 
place only at the region heated at that time, so the region 
heated and elongated is quite small. The V 2 is equal to 
the speed at the steady state when the following equation 
is valid.

[0105] Therefore, the V 2 can be set by adjusting the 
V 1 and the moving speed of the tail stock 116 based on 
the D 1 and the D 2 . The tensile stress of the glass rod 106 
at the steady state is the tensile stress when the glass 
rod 106 is elongated with the tail stock 116 moving speed 
at the steady state. 
[0106] Fig. 32 shows a process where the diameter 
fluctuates during the elongation of the glass rod 106. The 
glass rod 106 softens when heated. As shown in Fig. 32 
(1), it may happen that the glass rod 106 cannot be sof-
tened enough by the pre-heating only to be elongated. 
The tensile stress generated on the glass rod 106 in-
creases from twice to triple the normal tensile stress when 
the heating source 122 and the tail stock 116 start to 
move at the prescribed speed. Then, the region which is 
pre-heated is elongated rapidly, and the diameter of the 
pre-heated region is reduced as shown in shaded portion 
of Fig. 32 (2). The elongation of the glass rod 106 occurs 
almost entirely in the pre-heated region, and the region 
which is heated newly by the heating source 122, is less 
elongated. Therefore, necking of the diameter has oc-
curred on the glass rod 106 as shown in Fig. 32 (3). 
[0107] The fluctuation of the diameter of the glass rod 
106 tends to occur at the region from the starting place 
of the elongation of the glass rod 106to the place 50 mm 
away from the starting place. If the elongation is pro-
gressed further than this place, the speed of providing 
the heat to the glass rod 106, the speed that the glass 
rod 106 softens, and the elongation speed of the glass 
rod 106 are balanced to be a steady state. Therefore, 
the fluctuation of the diameter of the glass rod 106 will 
not occur as shown in Fig. 32 (4). 
[0108] The glass rod 106 is elongated by controlling 
the moving speed of the tail stock 116. The aim is to keep 
the tensile stress of the glass rod 106 at the early stage 
of the elongation at substantially 110 % or less of the 
average value of the tensile tension at the steady state. 
The fluctuation of the diameter at the early stage of the 
elongation of the glass rod 106 can thus be decreased. 
This is because the heat supply to the glass rod 106, the 
soften speed of the glass rod 106, and the elongation 
speed of the glass rod 106 can be balanced. 
[0109] If the tensile stress of the glass rod 106 at the 
early stage is lower than 80 % of the steady state, the 
distance required for the diameter of the glass rod 106 
to reach the target value becomes long. Therefore, the 
region of the elongated glass rod 106 that can be used 
as product becomes short. This decreases the yield fac-
tor of the process and increases the time taken for the 
glass rod 106 to reach the target diameter. Therefore, it 
is desirable to control the tensile stress of the glass rod 
106 at the early stage of the elongation in the range of 
substantially from 80 % to 110 % of the average value 
of the tensile stress at the steady state. 

[0110] Fig. 33 shows a glass rod 106 that is elongated 
according to the elongating (S154) shown in Fig. 31. First, 
as shown in Fig. 33 (1) and (2), the heating source 122 
and the tail stock 116 start to move after the pre-heating 
of the glass rod 106 to start the elongation of the glass 
rod 106. Because the tensile stress of the glass rod 106 
is controlled to be 110 % or less of the tensile stress at 
the steady state, excessive tensile stress is not applied 
to the glass rod 106. No necking therefore occurs on the 
glass rod 106 due to rapid elongation. If the heating 
source 122 moves the prescribed distance under this bal-
anced condition, the heat supplied to the glass rod 106, 
the soften speed of the glass rod 106, and the elongation 
speed of the glass rod 106 are balanced. Thus the fluc-
tuation of the diameter of the glass rod 106 can be pre-
vented. 
[0111] Fluctuation of the diameter may occur if the 
moving speed of the tail stock 116 continues to be con-
trolled based on the tensile stress. The tensile stress of 
the glass rod 106 will change with small changes in the 
heat quantity provided by the heating source 122. The 
moving speed of the tail stock 116 then fluctuates to main-
tain the tensile stress of the glass rod 106 at a constant, 
resulting in fluctuation of the diameter of the elongated 
glass rod 106. Therefore, fluctuations in the diameter of 
the glass rod 106 caused by subtle fluctuations of the 
tensile stress can be prevented by changing the moving 
speed of the tail stock 116 to the speed at the steady 
state after the heating source 122 moves a prescribed 
distance on commencement of elongation. 
[0112] The change in moving speed of the tail stock 
116 to the speed of the steady state is made when the 
heating source 122 has moved substantially from 50 mm 
to 150 mm from the point of the start of the elongation. 
Until the heating source 122 moves 50 mm from the point 
of commencement of elongation, the heat supplied to the 
glass rod 106, the soften speed of the glass rod 106, and 
the elongation speed of the glass rod 106 are not bal-
anced. The result is, necking of the glass rod 106 will 
occur due to the fluctuation of the diameter if the elon-
gation speed is changed to the speed of the steady state 
before the heating source 122 has moved 50 mm. The 
tensile stress of the glass rod 106 should thus be con-
trolled to be substantially 110 % or less of the steady 
state until the heating source 122 moves substantially 50 
mm. It is desirable to change the moving speed of the 
tail stock 116 to the speed of the steady state before the 
heating source 122 moves more than substantially 150 
mm. 

(EXAMPLE) 

[0113] The glass rod 106 was elongated by the glass 
rod second elongating apparatus 111. The glass rod 106 
had an outside diameter of 65 mm and length of 980 mm. 
The dummy rods 108, which had outside diameters of 
60 mm and lengths of 250 mm, were welded on both 
ends of the glass rod 106. The rotation speed around the

axis during the welding of the glass rod 106 and the dum-
my rod 108 was 30 rpm. An oxygen hydrogen burner was 
used for the heating source 122. The oxygen gas and 
hydrogen gas provided to the heating source 122 was 
96 liters/ minute and 240 liters/ minute respectively. 
[0114] After pre-heating of the glass rod 106, the elon-
gation of the glass rod was started by moving the heating 
source 122 at a moving speed of 12.4 mm/min. When 
elongating the glass rod 106 to reduce the diameter of 
the glass rod 106 from 65 mm to 50 mm, the tensile stress 
at the steady state was about 100 kgf/cm 2 , and the mov-
ing speed of the tail stock 116 at the steady state was 
8.6 mm/min. The moving speed of the tail stock 116 was 
controlled so that the tensile stress did not exceed 110 
kgf/cm 2 until the heating source 122 had moved 100 mm 
from the starting point of the elongation. After the heating 
source 122 moved 100 mm, the glass rod 106 was elon-
gated by controlling the moving speed of the tail stock 
116 to 8.6 mm/min, which is the speed at the steady state. 
[0115] Fig. 34 shows the tensile stress of the glass rod 
106 at the early stage of the elongation of the example. 
The vertical axis shows the tensile stress generated in 
the glass rod 106 and the horizontal axis shows the mov-
ing distance of the heating source 122 after the start of 
elongation. The tensile stress of the glass rod 106 was 
110 kgf/cm 2 or less at the early stage of the elongation 
while the heating source 122 moved forward 100 mm. 
[0116] Fig. 36 shows the fluctuation of the diameter of 
the glass rod 106 after the elongation of the glass rod 
106. The vertical axis shows the distance along the ra-
diant direction of the glass rod 106, and the horizontal 
axis shows the distance along the longitudinal direction 
of the glass rod 106. The glass rod 106 elongated by the 
method according to the example had few diameter fluc-
tuations such as necking, and the diameter of the glass 
rod 106 could be reduced to the target diameter at about 
100 mm of the longitudinal distance after the elongation 
started. The accuracy of the diameter of the glass rod 
106 at the region which was elongated at the speed of 
the steady state by the method according to the example 
was about the same accuracy as the diameter of the glass 
rod 106 which was elongated by the conventional elon-
gating method. 

(COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE) 

[0117] A glass rod 106 with a diameter of 65 mm was 
elongated to a diameter of 50 mm. The conditions of the 
moving speed and the amount of gas to the heating 
source 122 were the same as the above example. The 
glass rod 106 was elongated by controlling the moving 
speed of the tail stock 116 to 8.6 mm/min from the start 
of the elongation. This is the speed at the steady state. 
[0118] Fig. 35 shows a fluctuation of the tensile stress 
of the glass rod 106 at the early stage of the elongation 
of the comparative example. The vertical axis shows the 
tensile stress generated in the glass rod 106, and the 
horizontal axis shows the moving distance of the heating 

source 122 after commencement of elongation. The ten-
sile stress of the glass rod 106 increased to 300 kgf/cm 2 
at the early stage of the elongating, which is 3 times great-
er than the tensile stress of the steady state. This oc-
curred whilst the heating source 122 was moving the in-
itial 100 mm. 
[0119] As shown in Fig. 36, the glass rod 106 after the 
elongation of the comparative example had large necking 
at about 100 mm from the start of the elongation. Because 
the undulation continues until about 300 mm from the 
start of the elongation, this region cannot be used as 
product, and the yield rates decreased. 
[0120] Fig. 37 shows a detailed flow chart of the end 
drawing (S158) shown in Fig. 26. First, the position, of 
the glass rod 106 which has been end-drawn is detected 
(S169). Next, the prescribed region of the glass rod 106 
is pre-heated by the flame of the heating source 122 
(S170) until the prescribed region nearly softens. Then, 
the glass rod 106 is elongated by heating the prescribed 
region of the glass rod 106 with the heating source 122 
and moving the tail stock 116 so that the diameter of the 
prescribed region is reduced (S172). 
[0121] The heating source 122 is moved from the cent-
er of the prescribed region to a region towards the middle 
side of the glass rod 106. Then, the heating source 122 
heats the glass rod 106 secondly (S174) with a flame. 
The thickness of this flame is smaller than the thickness 
of the flame of the pre-heating (S170). The prescribed 
region of the glass rod 106 is further elongated by moving 
the tail stock 116 so that the diameter of the prescribed 
region is reduced (S176). Then, the prescribed region of 
the glass rod 106 is fused by the flame. Again the thick-
ness of this flame is smaller than the thickness of the 
flame of the pre-heating (S170). 
[0122] Fig. 38 shows a cut 284 that is provided as a 
mark on the connection between the glass rod 106 and 
the dummy rod 108. This allows the detection of the po-
sition of the end drawing at the end drawing position de-
tecting (S169) shown in Fig. 37. A mark is provided on 
the connection between the glass rod 106 and the dummy 
rod 108. The device that recognizes the mark is installed 
on the glass rod second elongating apparatus 111 to de-
tect the location of the mark. 
[0123] The position of the start of the end drawing proc-
ess is set based on the detected mark location. The elon-
gation process of the glass rod 106 finishes at the set 
end drawing starting position, and the end drawing proc-
ess of the glass rod 106 starts at the same time. The 
method shown in Fig. 38 is used when the device that 
recognizes the mark is a device that measures the diam-
eter. An example of such a device would be a diameter 
measurement device 124. 
[0124] Fig. 39 shows a fluorescent paint 287 that is 
applied on the connection between the glass rod 106 and 
the dummy rod 108 as another example of a mark. The 
method shown in Fig. 39 is used when the device that 
recognizes the mark is an image processing apparatus.

apparatus 111 that detects the cut 284 at end drawing 
position detecting (S169). First, the dummy rod 108 is 
welded on both ends of the glass rod 106. The glass rod 
106, which has the dummy rod 108 on both sides, is fixed 
on the fixed chuck 118 and movable chuck 119, not 
shown in the figure. The cut 284 having depth of 3 mm 
is provided all around the welded position. The welded 
position results from the connection between the glass 
rod 106 and the dummy rod 108. 
[0126] During the elongation of the glass rod 106, the 
diameter measurement device 124 measures the diam-
eter of the glass rod 106. When the diameter measure-
ment device 124 detects the position of the cut 284 by 
detecting a change in diameter of the glass rod 106, the 
glass rod second elongating apparatus 111 starts the 
end drawing. The position of commencement of the end 
drawing is slightly towards the middle direction of the 
glass rod 106 from the connection between the glass rod 
106 and the dummy rod 108. Also, the position of com-
mencement of the end drawing does not have a bubble 
or bubbles with a diameter of 0.3 mm or above. Then, 
the process is shifted from elongation to end drawing. 
[0127] When a mark is the marking 287, fluorescent 
paint is applied on the connection between the glass rod 
106 and the dummy rod 108. The camera of the image 
processing apparatus, which can detect the fluorescent 
paint, is installed on the position of the diameter meas-
urement device 124, which is provided on the moving 
stand 120. The camera processes the picture of the glass 
rod 106 during the elongation of the glass rod 106. If the 
camera detects the fluorescent paint, the glass rod sec-
ond elongating apparatus 111 starts the end drawing. 
The position of commencement of the end drawing is 
slightly towards the middle direction of the glass rod 106 
from the connection between the glass rod 106 and the 
dummy rod 108. Also, the position of starting the end 
drawing does not have a bubble or bubbles with a diam-
eter of 0.3 mm or above. Then, the process is shifted 
from elongation to end drawing. 
[0128] By providing a mark on the connection between 
the glass rod 106 and the dummy rod 108, the location 
of the connection can be accurately measured. There-
fore, a preform 107 of high quality and little variation in 
diameter and length can be manufactured. 
[0129] Fig. 41 shows the movements of the heating 
source 122 and the tail stock 116 after detecting the po-
sition of the end drawing (S169) during the end drawing 
process of the glass rod 106 shown in flow chart of Fig. 
37. At the pre-heating for end drawing (S170), the flame 
of the heating source 122 heats the glass rod 106 at the 
prescribed region until the glass rod 106 nearly softens. 
At elongating for end drawing (S172), the heating source 
122 heats the prescribed region of the glass rod 106, and 
the tail stock 116 elongates the prescribed region of the 
glass rod 106. This therefore reduces the diameter of the 
prescribed region. 
[0130] At second heating (S174), the tail stock 116 
stops, and the heating source 122 moves in the direction 

towards the middle side of the region of the glass rod 106 
(to the left in the figure), from the center of the prescribed 
region. Then, the heating source 122 heats the glass rod 
106 by flame, the thickness of which is smaller than the 
thickness of the flame of the pre-heating (S170). At the 
second elongating for end drawing (S176), the heating 
source 122 moves further to the left side in the figure and 
heats the glass rod 106. The tail stock 116 also moves 
to elongate the prescribed region of the glass rod 106. 
At fusing for end drawing (S178), the heating source 122 
heats the glass rod 106 by flame, the thickness of which 
is smaller than the thickness of the flame of the pre-heat-
ing (S170). The position of the heating source 122 is at 
the same position as the second elongating for end draw-
ing (S176). The tail stock 116 moves to fuse the glass 
rod 106. 
[0131] Fig. 42 shows an example of the settings of an-
other method of the end drawing process at the end draw-
ing (S158) shown in Fig. 37. This method controls the 
gas amount, the moving distance of the heating source 
122, and the moving speed of the tail stock 116 based 
on the progress time of the end drawing process of the 
glass rod 106. 
[0132] The gas amount, the moving distance of the 
heating source 122, and the moving speed of the tail 
stock 116 are set once. This setting is based on the lo-
cation of the cut 284, the changes of the length and the 
diameter of the glass rod 106 along the axial direction at 
the second heating condition and elongating speed set-
ting (S157). The glass rod second elongating apparatus 
111 then resets the gas amount, the moving distance of 
the heating source 122, and the moving speed of the tail 
stock 116 based on the progress time of the end drawing 
process of the glass rod 106 at the end drawing (S158). 
[0133] For example, at the pre-heating for the end 
drawing (S170), which is undertaken for 300 seconds, 
the moving distance of the heating source 122 is set to 
0 mm. The moving speed of the tail stock 116 is set to 0 
mm/ minute. The amount of hydrogen (H 2 ) gas for the 
heating source 122 is set to 250 cc/ minute. The amount 
oxygen (O 2 ) gas (inside) that is output from the inside 
nozzle of the heating source 122 is set to 30 cc/ minute. 
The amount of oxygen (O 2 ) gas (outside) that is output 
from the outside nozzle of the heating source 122 is set 
to 100 cc/ minute. The glass rod 106 is heated by the 
heating source 122, which is set according to the above 
conditions. 
[0134] At the elongating for end drawing (S172), which 
is undertaken for 60 seconds, the amount of hydrogen 
(H 2 ) gas for the heating source 122 is set to 250 cc/ 
minute. The amount of the oxygen (O 2 ) gas (inside) that 
is output from the inside nozzle of the heating source 122 
is set to 30 cc/ minute. The amount of oxygen (O 2 ) gas 
(outside) that is output from the outside nozzle of the 
heating source 122 is set to 100 cc/ minute. The glass 
rod 106 is heated by the heating source 122, which is set 
according to the above conditions. With the moving dis-
tance of the heating source 122 at 0 mm, the tail stock

116 is moved at the speed of 10 mm/ minute to elongate 
the glass rod 106. 
[0135] At the second heating (S174), which is under-
taken for 20 seconds, the moving speed of the tail stock 
116 is set to 0 mm/ minute. The moving distance of the 
heating source 122 is set to 15 mm. The amount of hy-
drogen (H 2 ) gas for the heating source 122 is set to 130 
cc/ minute. The amount of oxygen (O 2 ) gas (inside) that 
is output from the inside nozzle of the heating source 122 
is set to 15 cc/ minute. The amount oxygen (O 2 ) gas (out-
side) that is output from the outside nozzle of the heating 
source 122 is set to 50 cc/ minute. The glass rod 106 is 
heated by the heating source 122, which is set according 
to the above conditions. 
[0136] At the second elongating for end drawing 
(S176), which is undertaken for 180 seconds, the moving 
distance of the heating source 122 is increased from 15 
mm to 25mm. The amount of hydrogen (H 2 ) gas for the 
heating source 122 is set to 130 cc/ minute. The amount 
oxygen (O 2 ) gas (inside) that is output from the inside 
nozzle of the heating source 122 is set to 15 cc/ minute. 
The amount of oxygen (O 2 ) gas (outside) that is output 
from the outside nozzle of the heating source 122 is set 
to 50 cc/ minute. The glass rod 106 is heated by the heat-
ing source 122, which is set according to the above con-
ditions. The tail stock 116 is moved at a speed of 10 mm/ 
minute to elongate the glass rod 106. 
[0137] Finally, at the fusing for end drawing (S178), 
which is undertaken for 30 seconds, the heating source 
122 does not move from the position at the second elon-
gating for end drawing (S176), so the moving distance 
remains at 25 mm. The amount of hydrogen (H 2 ) gas for 
the heating source 122 is set to 130 cc/ minute. The 
amount of oxygen (O 2 ) gas (inside) that is output from 
the inside nozzle of the heating source 122 is set to 30 
cc/ minute. The amount oxygen (O 2 ) gas (outside) that is 
output from the outside nozzle of the heating source 122 
is set to 20 cc/ minute. The glass rod 106 is heated by 
the heating source 122, which is set according to the 
above conditions. The tail stock 116 is moved at a speed 
of 120 mm/ minute to fuse the glass rod 106. 
[0138] The glass rod 106 with a diameter of 60 mm 
was end-drawn by the glass rod second elongating ap-
paratus 111 according to the setting condition shown in 
Fig. 42. The shape of the preform at the region that was 
end-drawn, was a well formed circular cone shape. The 
length and the diameter of the region were 61 mm and 
60 mm respectively. The time that was required for the 
end drawing process was 12 minutes. 
[0139] As shown above, because each glass rod 106 
is heated and elongated under the same conditions, a 
preform 107 of high quality and little variation in diameter 
can be manufactured. 
[0140] Fig. 43 shows another example of the settings 
of other method of the end drawing process at the end 
drawing (S158) shown in Fig. 37. This method controls 
the gas amount, the moving speed of the heating source 
122, and the moving speed of the tail stock 116 based 

on the moving distance of the tail stock 116. 
[0141] The glass rod second elongating apparatus 111 
detects the moving distance of the tail stock 116. The 
moving distance of the heating source 122, and the mov-
ing speed of the tail stock 116 are set once based on the 
location of the cut 284, the change of the length of the 
glass rod 106 along the axial direction, and the diameter 
of the glass rod 106 at the second heating condition and 
elongating speed setting (S157). The glass rod second 
elongating apparatus 111 resets the gas amount, the 
moving distance of the heating source 122, and the mov-
ing speed of the tail stock 116 based on the detected 
moving distance of the tail stock 116 at the end drawing 
(S158). 
[0142] There is a case where the moving distance of 
the tail stock cannot be measured because the tail stock 
does not move. This might occur from lack of power of 
the tail stock driving motor 275 when the glass rod 106 
is not heated sufficiently during the end drawing process. 
When the output of the tail stock driving motor 275 is not 
large enough, the AC servomotor, which can detect the 
torque of the output shaft, can be used for driving the tail 
stock 116. A threshold value can be set for the torque 
generated in the tail stock driving motor 275. When the 
torque exceeds the threshold value, the glass rod second 
elongating apparatus 111 can judge that the heating is 
insufficient. Then, the glass rod second elongating ap-
paratus 111 can stop the driving of the tail stock 116 for 
a period of time and increase the gas amount supplied 
to the heating source 122. 
[0143] The settings shown in Fig. 43 are the same as 
the settings shown in Fig. 42 except that the "Progress 
Time" setting changes to the "Tail Stock 116 Moving Dis-
tance" setting. The end drawing method shown in Fig. 
43 also has the processes of pre-heating for end drawing 
(S170), elongating for end drawing (S172), the second 
heating (S174), second elongating for end drawing 
(S176), and fusing for end drawing (S178). The gas 
amount and moving distance of the heating source 122, 
and the moving speed of the tail stock 116 are set based 
on the moving distance of the tail stock 116 at each stage 
of the process. 
[0144] For example, at the pre-heating for the end 
drawing (S170), because the moving speed of the tail 
stock 116 is set to 0 mm/ minute, the time after the com-
mencement of the pre-heating for end drawing is meas-
ured for 300 seconds. That is, for 300 seconds the moving 
distance of the heating source 122 is set to 0 mm. The 
amount hydrogen (H 2 ) gas for the heating source 122 is 
set to 250 cc/ minute. The amount of oxygen (O 2 ) gas 
(inside) that is output from the inside nozzle of the heating 
source 122 is set to 30 cc/ minute. The amount of oxygen 
(O 2 ) gas (outside) that is output from the outside nozzle 
of the heating source 122 is set to 100 cc/ minute. The 
glass rod 106 is heated by the heating source 122, which 
is set according to the above conditions. When the time 
after the commencement of the pre-heating for end draw-
ing passes 300 seconds, the process is shifted to next

step. 
[0145] At the elongating for end drawing (S172), whilst 
the moving distance is changed from 0 mm to 30 mm, 
the amount hydrogen (H 2 ) gas for the heating source 122 
is set to 250 cc/ minute. The amount of oxygen (O 2 ) gas 
(inside) that is output from the inside nozzle of the heating 
source 122 is set to 30 cc/ minute. The amount oxygen 
(O 2 ) gas (outside) that is output from the outside nozzle 
of the heating source 122 is set to 100 cc/ minute. The 
glass rod 106 is heated by the heating source 122, which 
is set according to the above conditions. With the moving 
distance of the heating source 122 as 0 mm, the tail stock 
116 is moved at a speed of 10 mm/ minute to elongate 
the glass rod 106. 
[0146] At the second heating (S174), the moving 
speed of the tail stock 116 is set to 0 mm/ minute so that 
the moving distance of the tail stock 116 remains at 30 
mm. The moving distance of the heating source 122 is 
set to 15 mm. The amount of hydrogen (H 2 ) gas for the 
heating source 122 is set to 130 cc/ minute. The amount 
of oxygen (O 2 ) gas (inside) that is output from the inside 
nozzle of the heating source 122 is set to 15 cc/ minute. 
The amount of oxygen (O 2 ) gas (outside) that is output 
from the outside nozzle of the heating source 122 is set 
to 50 cc/ minute. The glass rod 106 is heated by the heat-
ing source 122, which is set according to the above con-
ditions. After the heating source 122 has moved 15 mm, 
the process is shifted to next step Then, at the second 
elongating for end drawing (S176), whilst the moving dis-
tance of the tail stock 116 is increased from 30 mm to 55 
mm, the moving distance of the heating source 122 is 
increased from 15 mm to 25 mm. The amount hydrogen 
(H 2 ) gas for the heating source 122 is set to 130 cc/ 
minute. The amount of oxygen (O 2 ) gas (inside) that is 
output from the inside nozzle of the heating source 122 
is set to 15 cc/ minute. The amount of oxygen (O 2 ) gas 
(outside) that is output from the outside nozzle of the 
heating source 122 is set to 50 cc/ minute. The glass rod 
106 is heated by the heating source 122, which is set 
according to the above conditions. The tail stock 116 is 
moved at a speed of 10 mm/ minute to elongate the glass 
rod 106. 
[0147] Finally, at the fusing for end drawing (S178), 
whilst the moving distance of the tail stock 116 increased 
from 55 mm to 100 mm, the heating source 122 did not 
move from the position at the second elongating for end 
drawing (S176). The moving distance therefore remains 
at 25mm. The amount hydrogen (H 2 ) gas for the heating 
source 122 is set to 130 cc/ minute. The amount of oxygen 
(O 2 ) gas (inside) that is output from the inside nozzle of 
the heating source 122 is set to 30 cc/ minute. The amount 
of oxygen (O 2 ) gas (outside) that is output from the out-
side nozzle of the heating source 122 is set to 20 cc/ 
minute. The glass rod 106 is heated by the heating source 
122, which is set according to the above conditions. The 
tail stock 116 is moved at a speed of 120 mm/ minute to 
fuse the glass rod 106. 

(EXAMPLE 1) 

[0148] A glass rod 106 having a diameter of 60 mm 
was end-drawn according to the setting values shown in 
Fig. 43. An AC servomotor of 200 W was used for the 
tail stock driving motor 275. A rotary encoder that can 
detect the amount of rotation of the tail stock driving motor 
275 was used as the tail stock driving encoder 273. The 
rotation speed of the tail stock driving motor 275 was 
controlled by the output of the tail stock driving encoder 
273. The moving distance of the tail stock 116 was ob-
tained by measuring the output of the tail stock driving 
encoder 273. The time required for the end drawing was 
15 minutes. The shape of the processed glass rod 106 
at the region which was end-drawn was a well formed 
circular cone shape. The length and the diameter of the 
region were 61 mm and 60 mm respectively. 

(EXAMPLE 2) 

[0149] A glass rod 106 having a diameter of 60 mm 
was end-drawn according to the setting values shown in 
Fig. 43. A linear encoder that can detect the moving dis-
tance of the tail stock 116 was provided on the tail stock 
116. The gas amount and the moving distance of the 
heating source 122, and the moving speed of the tail 
stock 116 were controlled based on the moving distance 
of the tail stock 116 detected by the linear encoder. The 
shape of the processed glass rod 106 at the region that 
was end-drawn was a well formed circular cone. The 
length and the diameter of the region were 65 mm and 
60 mm respectively. 
[0150] As shown above, because each glass rod 106 
is heated and elongated under the same conditions, a 
preform 107 of high quality and little variation in diameter 
can be manufactured. 
[0151] Fig. 44 shows a configuration of the heating 
source 122 of the glass rod second elongating apparatus 
111. The bottom end of the outside pipe 285 of the heating 
source 122 is closed. The outside pipe 285 is connected 
to a combustible gas channel 312. This is a channel for 
hydrogen gas which is an example of a suitable combus-
tible gas. The heating source 122 has a combustible gas 
flow rate control unit 314 placed in the combustible gas 
channel 312. All of the inside pipes 286 are connected 
to an oxygen gas channel 308 through the branching tool 
316. The oxygen channel 308 is a channel for oxygen 
gas. An inert-gas channel 296 is connected to the oxygen 
gas channel 308 by the connecting element 302. An ox-
ygen gas flow rate control unit 310 is installed between 
the connecting element 302 and the entrance of the ox-
ygen gas channel 308. 
[0152] The inert-gas channel 296 has a valve 300 and 
an inert-gas flow rate control unit 298. The heating source 
122 has a control element 304 which controls a driving 
source 306 based on the data of the flow rate that is 
output from the oxygen gas flow rate control unit 310. 
The driving source 306 is connected to the valve 300.

The combustible gas flow rate control unit 314 and the 
oxygen gas flow rate control unit 310 control the flow rate 
of the hydrogen gas H 2 and oxygen gas O 2 shown in the 
Fig. 42 and Fig. 43. A valve such as an electric valve or 
electromagnetic valve can be used as the valve 300. A 
three directional pipe or a three directional valve can be 
used for the connecting element 302. 
[0153] Fig. 45 shows a plan view of the top of the heat-
ing source 122. A plurality of the inside pipes 286, each 
of which has an inside diameter of 1 mm and an outside 
diameter of 3 mm, is inserted into the outside pipe 285, 
which has an inside diameter of 30 mm. The inside pipes 
286 are placed around the center of the outside pipe 285 
in a plurality of rows of concentric circles. 
[0154] The inside pipes 286 are placed with regular 
spacing intervals for each row. The closer the rows are 
towards the outside of the outside pipe 285, the higher 
the density of the intervals of the inside pipe 286 for the 
each row becomes. The inside pipes 286 can be installed 
inside the outside pipe 285 with a homogeneous density. 
Oxygen gas flows inside the oxygen gas outlet 288, which 
is inside of the inside pipe 286. A combustible gas flows 
inside the combustible gas outlet 290, which is inside of 
the outside pipe 285. 
[0155] The movement of the heating source 122 will 
be explained below. Hydrogen gas flows into the outside 
pipe 285 through the combustible gas channel 312 from 
a hydrogen gas supply source, not shown in the figure. 
Oxygen gas is distributed to the inside pipe 286 by the 
branching tool 316. Oxygen gas is supplied from an ox-
ygen gas supply source (not shown in the figure) through 
the oxygen gas channel 308. The hydrogen and oxygen 
gas are mixed at the top of the outside pipe 285. A flame 
294 can be obtained by igniting the mixed gas. 
[0156] According to the purpose of the processing of 
the glass rod 106, the quantity of the hydrogen and ox-
ygen gas were adjusted by using the oxygen gas flow 
rate control unit 310 and the combustible gas flow rate 
control unit 314 to obtain the optimum flame condition. 
At this time, the signal that shows the flow rate of the 
oxygen gas is output from the oxygen gas flow rate con-
trol unit 310 to the control element 304. The linear speed 
of the oxygen gas is a value derived by dividing the flow 
rate of the oxygen gas by the area of the inside of the 
inside pipe 286. 
[0157] If the linear speed of the oxygen gas is 1.0 m/sec 
or under, the control element 304 drives the driving 
source 306 and opens the valve 300. Then, nitrogen gas, 
which is an inert gas, flows into the oxygen gas channel 
308 with a linear speed of 0.5 m/sec and is mixed with 
the oxygen gas. When changing the flow rate of the ox-
ygen, the control element 304 drives the driving source 
306 and closes the valve 300 if the linear speed of the 
oxygen reaches 1.1 m/sec. 
[0158] When reducing the flow rate of the combustible 
gas and oxygen gas to make the flame smaller, the region 
of high temperature near the top of the inside flame 
moves from the top of the heating source 122. This is 

because the flame 294 diffuses as a result of mixing the 
inert-gas with oxygen gas. Therefore, the surface tem-
perature of the top of the heating source 122 is main-
tained below 400°C, so that e oxidation of the heating 
source 122 can be prevented. 
[0159] When strong heating power is needed, the 
valve 300 for the inflow of the inert gas is closed because 
the combustion temperature drops if inert gas is mixed. 
At this time, because the flame 294 is large owing to the 
increase of the flow rate of the combustible gas and ox-
ygen gas, the region of high temperature of the flame 
294 is no longer at the top of the heating source 122. 
Therefore, the surface temperature of the top of the heat-
ing source 122 is maintained below 400°C. The genera-
tion of a pulse caused by the opening and closing of the 
valve 300 can be prevented by setting a different linear 
speed value for the oxygen gas at the time of opening 
and closing of the valve 300. This should be set to 1.0 
m/sec or below for opening and 1.1 m/sec or above for 
closing. 
[0160] It is desirable that the inert gas has a linear 
speed of between 0.5 m/sec to 2 m/sec as it flows by the 
opening of the valve 300. The linear speed of the inert 
gas is calculated by dividing the flow rate of the inert gas 
by the area inside the oxygen gas outlet 288 of the inside 
pipe 286. If the linear speed of the inert gas is 0.5 m/sec 
or below, it is difficult to control the temperature of the 
top of the heating source 122. On the other hand, if the 
linear speed of the inert gas is 2.0 m/sec or above, the 
hydrogen gas burns incompletely, and the temperature 
of the flame 294 decrease. 
[0161] If using a heating source 122 to heat the glass 
rod 106 with the flame 294, a metal oxide will not usually 
be generated at the top of the heating source 122. This 
is because the temperature of the top of the heating 
source 122 is maintained at 400°C or below. Therefore, 
a metal oxide does not attach to the glass rod 106, and 
a glass rod 106 of high quality can be manufactured. 
[0162] A glass rod 106 having an average diameter of 
65 mm was elongated by a glass rod second elongating 
apparatus 111 that has heating source 122 controlling 
the flow rate of the inert gas. The ratio of the number of 
glass rods 106 having foreign matter such as metal oxide 
to the total numbers of processed glass rod 106 was 0.2 
%. This is a low value compared to the ratio of glass rods 
made by the conventional heating source 122. For com-
parison, the ratio of the number of glass rods 106 having 
foreign matter such as metal oxide to the total numbers 
of the processed glass rods 106 became a high value of 
15 % when the glass rod 106 was elongated by always 
closing the valve 300. 
[0163] Fig. 46 shows a relationship between the linear 
speed of the oxygen gas and the temperature of the top 
of the heating source 122. This is illustrated for the case 
of always mixing oxygen gas with nitrogen gas having 
linear speed of 0.5 m/sec and of not mixing the oxygen 
gas with the nitrogen gas. The temperature of the top of 
the heating source 122 does not exceed 400°C when

mixing the nitrogen gas. The temperature reached 400°C 
to 700°C at the region where the linear speed of the ox-
ygen gas was 1 m/sec or under when the nitrogen gas 
was not mixed. Therefore, the surface temperature of the 
heating source 122 can be controlled by mixing the ox-
ygen gas with nitrogen gas when the linear speed of the 
oxygen gas is 1 m/sec or below. 
[0164] Fig. 47 shows the shape of a tip of the preform 
107, the diameter of which is reduced and which is fused 
at the end drawing (S158). The D represents the diameter 
of the preform 107. The O represents the location where 
the diameter of the preform 107 starts to be reduced. The 
P represents the location where the diameter D of the 
preform 107 is reduced to 1 % or below the original di-
ameter. The preform 107 has a taper shape, both ends 
of which can be shown by the equation 1/3D L 3D. 
Here, L represents the length between the location O and 
the location P. 
[0165] The time that the drawing reaches the steady 
state is the time from the setting of the preform 107 on 
the preform drawing apparatus 500 until the diameter 
and the drawn speed of the optical fiber reaches the pre-
scribed value. When the preform 107 is drawn to an op-
tical fiber, the original shape of the preform 107 influences 
the time it takes for the drawing to reach the steady state. 
This influence becomes larger as the diameter of the pre-
form 107 becomes larger. Then, the time taken for the 
drawing to reach the steady state becomes longer. 
[0166] The preform 107 having the shape of the equa-
tion 1/3D L 3D can reduce the time taken for the draw-
ing to reach the steady state. If L &lt; 1/3D, the time taken 
for the diameter and the drawn speed of the optical fiber 
to reach the prescribed value increases because the time 
that the tip of the preform 107 drops down becomes long-
er. If L &gt; 3D, the time taken for the tip of the preform 107 
to drop down can be decreased, but the time taken for 
the taper shape of the preform 107 to become the shape 
of the steady state of the drawing takes longer. Then, the 
time taken for the diameter and the drawn speed of the 
optical fiber to reach the prescribed value becomes long-
er. Therefore, it is best to make the shape of the taper of 
the preform 107 as L = D. 
[0167] In the case of fusing the preform 107 by heating 
part of the preform 107 by a flame, a residual strain re-
mains on both ends of the taper part of the preform 107. 
If the residual strain in the taper part is large, cracks can 
be generated on both ends of the preform 107 when a 
strong impact is applied on the preform 107. The cracks 
can also be generated on both ends of the preform 107 
by a thermal impact generated by the welding of the pre-
form 107 and the dummy rod. The quantity of the strain 
on both ends of the preform 107 would ideally be 40 
kgf/cm 2 or below. The cracks generated on the preform 
107 can be prevented by controlling the quantity of the 
residual strain remaining in the preform 107 at 40 kgf/cm 2 
or below. 

(EXAMPLE) 

[0168] A preform 107 with a diameter of 30 mm was 
drawn. The length L was set to 30 mm. The quantity of 
the strain remaining in the taper part of the preform 107 
was 40 kgf/cm 2 , and cracks were not generated during 
the welding of the preform 107 and the dummy rod. When 
the set diameter of the optical fiber was 125Pm and the 
speed of the drawing was 100 mm/min, the time that the 
drawing took to reach the steady state was a total of 20 
minutes. The time from the setting of the preform 107 on 
the preform drawing apparatus 500 to the dropping of 
the tip of the preform 107 was 10 minutes. The time taken 
for the diameter and the drawn speed of the optical fiber 
to reach the prescribed value was 10 minutes. 

(COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1) 

[0169] A preform 107 with a diameter of 30 mm was 
drawn. The length L was set to 5 mm. The quantity of the 
strain remaining in the taper part of the preform 107 was 
40 kgf/cm 2 , and cracks were not generated during the 
welding of the preform 107 and the dummy rod. When 
the set diameter of the optical fiber was 125Pm and the 
speed of the drawing was 100 mm/min, the time that the 
drawing reached d the steady state was a total of 50 
minutes. The time from the setting of the preform 107 on 
the preform drawing apparatus 500 to the dropping of 
the tip of the preform 107 was 20 minutes. The time taken 
for the diameter and the drawn speed of the optical fiber 
to reach the prescribed value was 30 minutes. 

(COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2) 

[0170] A preform 107 with a diameter of 30 mm was 
drawn. The length L was set to 100 mm. The quantity of 
the strain remaining in the taper part of the preform 107 
was 40 kgf/cm 2 , and cracks were not generated during 
the welding of the preform 107 and the dummy rod. When 
the set diameter of the optical fiber was 125Pm and the 
speed of the drawing was 100 mm/min, the time taken 
for the drawing to reach the steady state was a total of 
40 minutes. The time from the setting of the preform 107 
on the preform drawing apparatus 500 to the dropping 
of the tip of the preform 107 was 10 minutes. The time 
taken for the diameter and the drawn speed of the optical 
fiber to reach the prescribed value was 30 minutes. 

(COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 3) 

[0171] A preform 107 with a diameter of 30 mm was 
drawn. The length L was set to be 30 mm. The quantity 
of the strain remaining in the taper part of the preform 
107 was 60 kgf/cm 2 . The preform 107 could not be drawn 
because cracks were generated during the welding of 
the preform 107 and the dummy rod. 
[0172] As shown above, the time required for drawing 
the preform 107 to an optical fiber can be reduced by

making the shape of the tip of the preform 107 as 
1/3D L 3D. 
[0173] Fig. 48 shows another shape of the tip of the 
preform 107 that was end-drawn. The preform 107 shown 
in Fig. 48 has a fused part 332 on one end formed by a 
flame, and a cutting face 334 on the other end, which is 
cut mechanically. The fused part 332, which is shown in 
Fig. 48 (a), is fused rapidly by a flame. The fused part 
332, which is shown in Fig. 48 (b), is fused gradually by 
reducing the diameter to form a taper part 336. A thin 
part 338 is provided on the tip of the fused part 332 shown 
in Fig. 48 (c). 
[0174] When drawing a preform 107 which has the ta-
per part 336 as shown in Fig. 48 (b), the time taken for 
the tip of the preform 107 to dropdown is short, and the 
quantity of preform 107 to be dropped is also small be-
cause the diameter of the fused part 332 is small. When 
drawing a preform 107 which has the taper part 336 and 
thin part 338 as shown in Fig. 48 (c), the time taken for 
the tip of the preform 107 to drop down can be reduced 
to one third or less of the time required for the conven-
tional shape of the preform 107. The loss in material 
caused by the dropping of the preform 107 can be limited 
to the small quantity of the thin part 338. 
[0175] It is desirable that the shape of the thin part 338 
occupies between 0.1 percent to 15 percent of the weight 
of the fused part 332. If the weight of the thin part 338 is 
smaller than 0.1 percent of the weight of the fused part 
332, the effect produced by providing the thin part 338 
cannot be obtained. On the other hand, if the weight of 
the thin part 338 is larger than 15 percent of the weight 
of the fused part 332, the time taken for the tip of the 
preform 107 to drop becomes long, and the loss of pre-
form 107 increases during the drawing. 
[0176] It is desirable that the diameter of the thin part 
338 be between 1/2 to 1/10 of the diameter of the main 
body of the preform 107. If the diameter of the thin part 
338 is within this range, the time required for the dropping 
of the tip of the preform 107 at the early stage of the 
drawing can be short. If the length of the thin part 338 is 
approximately one to five times this diameter, the loss of 
the preform 107 can be limited to a small quantity. 
[0177] Fig. 49 shows a preform 107 that is damaged, 
before the preform 107 is surface treated at the surface 
treatment (S168) shown in the Fig. 26. The preform 107, 
which is elongated by the glass rod second elongating 
apparatus 111, is etched by hydrofluoric acid as a surface 
treatment. This cuts the cladding of the preform 107 
chemically so that the preform 107 has the prescribed 
ratio of thickness of core to cladding. 
[0178] The hydrofluoric acid etching treatment is a 
treatment that decomposes the bonds between the Sili-
con and oxygen of the glass. The hydrofluoric acid etch-
ing treatment cuts the surface of the preform 107 chem-
ically at a speed of about 8 mm per one hour. However, 
if there is a crack or a concave on the surface of the 
preform 107, the place having the crack or concave is 
cut further to form a larger concave than the concave 

made on the other parts of the preform 107. This concave 
caused by the treatment of hydrofluoric acid etching is 
called a hydrofluoric concave. This hydrofluoric concave 
is the cause of the breaking of an optical fiber during the 
drawing of the preform 107 to an optical fiber. 
[0179] A preform 107 without hydrofluoric concaves 
on its surface can be obtained by removing cracks and 
concaves on the preform 107 by polishing before the 
treatment of hydrofluoric acid etching. There is a method 
of fire polishing the preform 107 with the temperature 
above the strain point of the preform 107. During the fire 
polishing, the preform 107 is fire polished so that the un-
evenness of the surface will be within a 0.3 mm range. 
The generation of the hydrofluoric concave can be pre-
vented by fire polishing the preform 107 before etching 
the preform 107 with hydrofluoric acid. This is possible 
because the quantity of the strain in the preform 107 can 
be decreased and a smooth surface without cracks can 
be obtained. Not only is fire polishing suitable, but also 
mechanical polishing can be used for polishing the pre-
form 107. 
[0180] Fig. 51 shows a number of hydrofluoric con-
caves generated in the preform 107 counted by visual 
inspection of the example and the comparative example. 
Fig. 52 shows the unevenness of the surface of the pre-
form 107 after the treatment with the hydrofluoric acid 
etching of the example and the comparative example. In 
the pre-treating 1 shown in Fig. 51 and Fig. 52, the pre-
form 107a having a diameter of 60 mm and a length of 
1000 mm was damaged. First, the preform 107a and the 
other preform 107b, which had the same shape as the 
preform 107a, were placed on the floor. 
[0181] Next, one end of the preform 107a was lifted to 
height of 10 cm while the other end remained on the floor. 
Then, the end of the preform 107 that was lifted was 
dropped onto the preform 107b so that the preform 107a 
had a crack. Each of a plurality of the preform 107a was 
damaged in 3 places at 20 cm intervals by the same 
method shown above. On the pre-treating 2 shown in 
Fig. 51 and Fig. 52, the preform 107a was lifted to a height 
of the 20 cm. The other procedure of damaging the pre-
form 107 was same as pre-treating 1. 
[0182] On the example shown in Fig. 51 and Fig. 52, 
each of the preform 107a was treated by the pre-treating 
1 and pre-treating 2. Then, each of the preform 107a was 
fire polished with a burner that was provided with hydro-
gen gas at 250 ml/min and oxygen gas at 145 ml/min. 
Each of the fire polished preform 107a was treated by 
hydrofluoric acid etching at room temperature. The thick-
ness of material etched from the exterior diameter of the 
preform 107 was one of 4 steps of 0.2 mm, 1.2 mm, 2.2 
mm, and 3.2 mm. 10 pieces of the preform 107a were 
etched by hydrofluoric acid for each of the 4 steps of the 
etching thickness. The number of the hydrofluoric con-
caves was checked by visual inspection after the treat-
ment by hydrofluoric acid etching. 
[0183] Fig. 50 shows the preform 107a, which was 
treated by the hydrofluoric acid etching in the example

shown in the Fig. 51 and Fig. 52. The unevenness of the 
surface of the preform 107a was obtained by measuring 
the difference of the diameter between the point which 
was shown by the mark x and the diameter of the point 
which was shown by the mark o. The point which was 
shown by the mark x was the place damaged by contact-
ing with preform 107b. The point which was shown by 
the mark o was a place 10 cm away from the point of the 
mark x, which was not damaged by contacting with pre-
form 107b. The average value of the diameter of the 3 
points shown by the mark x were used as the diameter 
of the each of the preform 107a. 
[0184] In the comparative example shown in Fig. 51 
and Fig. 52, each of the preform 107 treated by pre-treat-
ment 1 and pre-treatment 2 were treated by hydrofluoric 
acid etching without fire polishing. The number of hy-
drofluoric concaves was assessed by visual inspection, 
and the unevenness of the surface was measured in the 
same way as the example. As shown in Fig. 52 and Fig. 
53, the unevenness of the surface of the pre-treatment 
2 was larger than the unevenness of the surface of the 
pre-treatment 1. This is because pre-treatment 2 was 
lifted higher pre-treatment 1 in the damage process. Also, 
the number of hydrofluoric concaves generated by the 
hydrofluoric acid etching of the pre-treatment 2 was larg-
er than the number of the hydrofluoric concaves of the 
pre-treatment 1. 
[0185] The larger the quantity of the etching, the larger 
the unevenness of the surface of the preform 107. Also, 
the larger the quantity of the etching, the larger the 
number of hydrofluoric concaves generated by the hy-
drofluoric acid etching. The unevenness of the surface 
of the preform 107a of the example which was fire pol-
ished, was lower than the unevenness of the surface of 
the preform 107a of the comparative example, which was 
not fire polished. 
[0186] The number of the hydrofluoric concave gener-
ated on the example is smaller than the number of the 
hydrofluoric concave generated on the comparative ex-
ample as shown in Fig. 51. Therefore, the number of the 
hydrofluoric concave in the preform 107a and the une-
venness of the surface of the preform 107a can be de-
creased by fire polishing the preform 107a before etching 
the preform 107a with hydrofluoric acid. 
[0187] Fig. 53 shows another shape of the preform 107 
which is surface treated. The preform 107 has a handle 
340. The handle 340 is made of a silica glass and is 
installed on the cutting face 334 of the surface treated 
preform 107 shown in Fig. 48 (c) by welding or mechan-
ical processing. The preform 107 with a handle 340 can 
be installed onto the preform drawing apparatus 500 
promptly when drawing the preform 107 to an optical fib-
er. The diameter of the handle 340, installed on the cut-
ting face 334, can be smaller than the diameter of the 
preform 107 as shown in Fig. 53 (b). 
[0188] Fig. 54 shows an ultrasonic cleaning apparatus 
404, which cleans the heating source 122. The ultrasonic 
cleaning apparatus 404 comprises an ultrasonic oscilla-

tor 396. A cleaning liquid 398 is contained inside of the 
ultrasonic cleaning apparatus 404. The cleaning liquid 
398 contains 10 percent hydrofluoric acid and 3 percent 
nitric acid. The hydrofluoric acid dissolves the metal oxide 
generated on the surface of the outside pipe 285 and 
inside pipe 286 of the heating source 122. Oxidation of 
the surface of the outside pipe 285 and the inside pipe 
286 does not readily occur if the outside pipe 285 and 
the inside pipe 286 are made of stainless steel. This is 
because iron, chromium, and nickel, which are contained 
in stainless steel, form a passive thin film on the surface 
of the stainless steel from the effect of the nitric acid, thus 
protecting the surfaces. 
[0189] The cleaning liquid 398 can contain a soluble 
organic solvent. Examples of soluble organic solvents 
are alcohol, acetone, acetonitrile, and tetrahydrofuran. 
The heating source 122 can be soaked in the cleaning 
liquid 398 containing hydrofluoric acid and then soaked 
in the other cleaning liquid 398 which contains nitric acid. 
The ultrasonic oscillator 396 oscillates an ultrasonic wave 
of strength of 1 W/cm 2 to 2 w/cm 2 . 
[0190] The heating source 122 to be cleaned is made 
of stainless steel. The heating source 122 has a plurality 
of inside pipes 286, which have an internal diameter of 
1 mm and an outside diameter of 3 mm. The inside pipes 
286 are inside the outside pipe 285, which has an internal 
diameter of 30 mm. Hydrogen gas flows inside the out-
side pipe 285, and oxygen gas flows inside the inside 
pipe 286. The outside pipe 285 is connected to a hydro-
gen inlet pipe 392, and all the inside pipes 286 are con-
nected to an oxygen inlet pipe 394. 
[0191] When the glass rod 106 is heated by the flame 
of the heating source 122, the temperature of the top of 
the heating source 122 increases to a high temperature 
of between 400°C to 700°C. Therefore, a metal oxide will 
be generated on the surface of the top of the heating 
source 122. The metal oxides gradually dislodges to be-
come free floating particles if the heating source is used 
for a long time. 
[0192] Particles of metal oxide or foreign matter impu-
rities such as glass particles attached to the heating 
source 122 may be dislodged during the heat treatment 
of the glass rod 106. These particles can attach to the 
surface of the glass rod 106 in which case the surface 
layer of the glass rod 106 has to be polished. If the glass 
rod 106 is polished, the ratio of the diameter of the clad-
ding and the core of the glass rod 106 will change. The 
characteristic of light transmission of an optical fiber 
made from the glass rod 106 will deteriorate as a result. 
Therefore, foreign matter impurities and metal oxides at-
tached to the heating source 122 are removed from the 
heating source 122 by cleaning the heating source 122. 
[0193] To clean the heating source 122 using the ul-
trasonic cleaning apparatus 404, first, the hydrogen inlet 
pipe 392 and oxygen inlet pipe 394 are opened to the 
outside. Then, the heating source 122 is soaked in the 
cleaning liquid 398 with the flame nozzle 390 directed 
downward. Any air remaining inside the outside pipe 285

and the inside pipe 286 is released through the hydrogen 
inlet pipe 392 and oxygen inlet pipe 394. Following this, 
the outside pipe 285 and the inside pipe 286 are im-
mersed and soaked in the cleaning liquid 398 to the top 
of the water level. The ultrasonic cleaning apparatus 404 
then cleans the heating source 122 by oscillating the ul-
trasonic wave using the ultrasonic oscillator 396. The vi-
bration frequency of the ultrasonic waves is 10 kHz to 
100 kHz. 
[0194] The heating source 122 was cleaned using the 
ultrasonic cleaning apparatus 404. Metal oxide was 
present around the stainless steel flame nozzle 390 of 
the heating source 122, which is used for heating the 
glass rod. The area around the flame nozzle 390 of the 
heating source 122 was soaked in the cleaning liquid 
398. To clean the heating source 122, an ultrasonic wave 
with a vibration frequency of 10 kHz to 100 kHz was os-
cillated for 30 minutes by the ultrasonic oscillator 396 
having output of 500 W. Then, the heating source 122 
was removed from the ultrasonic cleaning apparatus 404 
and any cleaning liquid 398 remaining on the surface of 
the heating source 122 was cleaned with pure water. The 
heating source 122 was then dried. 
[0195] The top of the outside pipe 285 and the inside 
pipe 286 were inspected, and metal oxides and foreign 
matter impurities were not found in the outside pipe 285 
and the inside pipe 286. The surface of the glass rod 106 
was heat treated by the cleaned heating source 122. The 
ratio of the number of glass rods 106, which had foreign 
matter impurities attached, compared to the total number 
of treated glass rods 106 was 6 percent. 
[0196] The surface of the glass rod 106 was heat treat-
ed by the heating source 122, which was not cleaned, 
for a comparison. In this case, the ratio of the number of 
glass rods 106, which had foreign matter impurities at-
tached, to the total number of heat treated glass rods 106 
was 15 percent. This is larger value than the ratio ob-
tained by the cleaned heating source 122. 
[0197] As shown above, the metal oxide and attached 
foreign matter generated on the top of the heating source 
122 can be removed by cleaning the heating source 122 
with the ultrasonic cleaning apparatus 404. A preform 
107 of high quality can be obtained by heating the glass 
rod 106 with a heating source 122, which is cleaned by 
the ultrasonic cleaning apparatus 404, because less for-
eign matter is attached to glass rod 106. 
[0198] Fig. 55 shows a configuration of the preform 
drawing apparatus 500 that draws the preform 107 to an 
optical fiber. The preform drawing apparatus 500 com-
prises a chuck 346, which holds a dummy rod 342 that 
is welded to the preform 107; a heating means 348 which 
heats the preform 107; movable support 344 which sup-
plies the preform 107 to the heating means 348; a diam-
eter measurement device 352 which measures the di-
ameter of an optical fiber 350 drawn from the preform 
107; a first coating device 354 which undertakes the first 
coating of the optical fiber 350; a first curing device 356 
which cures the first coated optical fiber 350 by a ultra-

violet rays; a second coating device 358 which coats the 
optical fiber 350 a second time; a second curing device 
360 which cures the second coated optical fiber 350 by 
a ultraviolet rays; and a tractor 362 which winds the op-
tical fiber 350. 
[0199] To draw the preform 107 into an optical fiber 
350 using the preform drawing apparatus 500, first, the 
dummy rod 342, which is welded to the preform 107, is 
held by the movable support 344 with the chuck 346. The 
starting end of the preform 107 is then set to the pre-
scribed position of the heating means 348, and the pre-
form 107 is heated. When the tip of the preform 107 sof-
tens and drops, the dropped tip of the preform 107 is 
caught and drawn out to be passed through the diameter 
measurement device 352. 
[0200] When the diameter of the optical fiber 350 
reaches the desired diameter, the optical fiber 350 is first 
coated with resin by passing through the first coating de-
vice 354. The first coated optical fiber 350 is then passed 
through the first curing device 356 to be cured. The optical 
fiber 350 is then second coated by the second coating 
device 358 and cured by the second curing device 360. 
When the diameter and the speed of the drawing of the 
optical fiber 350 reaches a prescribed value, the optical 
fiber 350 is wound onto a bobbin, not shown in the figure, 
through the the tractor 362. 
[0201] A preform 107 of high quality and little variation 
in diameter can be manufactured by the glass base ma-
terial first drawing apparatus 900 and the glass rod sec-
ond elongating apparatus 111 shown above. Therefore, 
optical fibers of high quality and reduced diameter vari-
ation can be manufactured by drawing the preform 107, 
manufactured by the glass base material first drawing 
apparatus 900 and the glass rod second elongating ap-
paratus 111, using the preform drawing apparatus 500. 
[0202] Although the present invention has been de-
scribed by reference to specific embodiments, the scope 
of the present invention is not limited to these embodi-
ments. Various modifications and improvements to these 
embodiments of the present invention can be made with-
out departing from the scope of the appended claims.

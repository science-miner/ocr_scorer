Claims 

1. An active filtering circuit comprising an operational amplifier (Op), the frequency response of which, in conjunction 
with an RC network (R 1 , R 2 , C 1 , C 2 ) included in the active filtering circuit, serves for determining a preset low-pass 
characteristic, the frequency response of the operational amplifier being an integral component of this preset low-
pass characteristic, characterised in that the operational amplifier (Op) includes a transconductance operational 
amplifier (2, 3, 4), which largely determines the frequency response of the operational amplifier through its transcon-
ductance (g m ) and a capacitor (Cc). 

2. The filtering circuit according to claim 1, characterised in that the transconductance (g m ) of the transconductance 
operational amplifier (2, 3, 4) is controllable through a bias circuit (1) such that it behaves so as to be inversely 
proportional to a transconductance-determinating resistor (Rb) in this bias circuit (1), which resistor is of the same 
type as the resistors (R1, R2) of the RC network (R 1 , R 2 , C 1 , C 2 ). 

3. The filtering circuit according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the current-determinating transistors in the bias 
circuit (1) are of the same conductivity type and essentially are in the same operating point like the input transistors 
of the transconductance operational amplifier (2, 3, 4) which are fed by the bias circuit (1). 

4. The filtering circuit according to any of the preceding claims, characterised in that the operational amplifier (Op) 
has a substantially constant gain reduction of -20dB/ decade in the range of the preset low-pass characteristic. 

5. The filtering circuit according to any of the preceding claims, characterised in that the RC network (R 1 , R 2 , C 1 , 
C 2 ) in conjunction with the operational amplifier (Op) forms a filtering circuit of second order. 

6. The filtering circuit according to any of the preceding claims, characterised in that the RC network (R 1 , R 2 , C 1 , 
C 2 ) and the operational amplifier (Op) are parts of a single monolithically integrated circuit, with the resistors (R 1 , 
R 2 ) and/or capacitors (C 1 , C 2 ), which are determinative for the frequency response, of the RC network and of the 
operational amplifier, are each produced according to the same production methods. 

7. The filtering circuit according to any of the claims 2 to 6, characterised in that the RC network (R 1 , R 2 , C 1 , C 2 ) 
and the operational amplifier (Op) including the transconductance operational amplifier (2, 3, 4) are parts of a single 
monolithically integrated circuit, with the resistors (R 1 , R 2 , Rb) which are determinative for the frequency response 
and the transconductance, and/or the capacitors (C 1 , C 2 , Cc), which are determinative for the frequency response, 
of the RC network and of the transconductance operational amplifier including the bias circuit (1), are each produced 
according to the same production methods. 

8. The filtering circuit according to any of the claims 1 to 7, characterised in that upstream or downstream of the 
filtering circuit the signal path is capacitively separated for the suppressing of direct voltage signals and low fre-
quencies. 

9. The filtering circuit according to any of the claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the circuitry of the operational 
amplifier (Op) is substantially symmetrical with regard to the two signal paths which are coupled with the inverting 
and non-inverting inputs (E1, E2), the operational amplifier having inverting and non-inverting outputs (P1, P2). 

10. The filtering circuit according to claim 9, characterised in that the RC network is symmetrical, and effecting the 
symmetry of the first RC network (R 1 , R 2 , C 1 , C 2 ) associated to the inverting input (E1) and the non-inverting output 
(P1) of the operational amplifier (Op) is accomplished by a symmetrical RC network (R 1 *, R 2 *, C 1 *, C 2 *) which is 
associated to the non-inverting input (E2) and the inverting output (P2) of the operational amplifier and has the same 
dimensioning as the dimensioning of the first RC network. 

11. The filtering circuit according to any of the claims 1 to 10, characterised in that, for separating interfering signals 
(fn) from the further processing, the filtering circuit is disposed downstream a mixer (8), which in particular is a co-

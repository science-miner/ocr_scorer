Rail and transit-oriented-development (TOD) projects are simultaneously optimized in this paper, with special consideration given 
to yearly variation and spatial and temporal correlation of population densities. In the proposed model, the objective is to minimize 
the investment risk of integrated rail and TOD projects with a given required expected return on investment. The investment risk 
is optimized based on closed-form solutions of the design variables, including rail line length, the number of TOD projects, and 
the number of housing units in each TOD project. The closed-form solutions are given explicitly under the assumption of social 
welfare maximization. It is found that underestimation exists for rail and TOD projects without consideration of the correlation 
of spatial and temporal population densities. TOD projects can greatly improve the return on investment of the rail operator. A 
numerical example is also presented. 

1. Introduction 

1.1. Literature Review and Motivation. The transit-oriented-
development (TOD) policy is one alternative approach to 
the development of rail projects with no requirement on 
direct financial subsidy from the government. Given this 
approach, the government may also grant the development 
rights of the land above underground rail stations or in their 
neighborhood areas to a private rail operator, in a form 
of indirect subsidies. The rail operator usually builds and 
operates a rail project and uses the revenue generated from it 
to finance the capital cost of it. In other words, rail and TOD 
projects are developed simultaneously, and TOD projects 
may be used to subsidize rail projects [1]. 
TOD projects have been investigated in many previous 
studies (such as [2-4]). Although TOD has been compre-
hensively discussed, analytical models for assisting TOD 
planners are still relatively few [4]. Li et al. [5] proposed a 
model to investigate the effects of integrated rail and property 

development projects on the design of rail line services in a 
linear monocentric city. Their study, however, was conducted 
in a particular year and the year-on-year investment risks of 
rail and TOD projects were not fully explored. 
The investment analysis of rail and TOD projects should 
be conducted over a relatively long period (at least a few 
years). The investment risks of these projects are closely and 
directly related to travel demand of rail service and popula-
tion densities in all residential locations, and their variations 
year on year. 
The correlation between spatial and temporal population 
densities in all residential locations (CPDRL) also affects 
the investment risk of rail and TOD projects. For instance, 
more households live in the first TOD project; fewer live 
in other TOD projects. In other words, negative spatial 
correlation exists between population densities in the first 
TOD project and the other TOD projects [6]. The increase 
of population density in the first year leads to the increase 
of population density in the second year, and then positive

temporal correlation exists between the first year and the 
second year, and vice versa. 
The investment risk of rail and TOD projects can be 
measured by standard deviation of return on investment 
(ROI) of these projects [7, 8]. The standard deviation of ROI 
is a function of yearly variation in population density and 
spatial and temporal correlations of population densities in 
all residential locations (CPDRL). 
In this paper, the rail and TOD projects are optimized 
simultaneously, with special consideration given to the yearly 
variation in population density and CPDRL. The proposed 
model can assist the authorities and/or operators in dealing 
with the investment risks of rail and TOD projects. 

1.2. Problem Statement and Intellectual Merits. As shown in 
Figure 1, rail and TOD projects are assumed to be developed 
simultaneously in a linear monocentric city. A rail project is 
assumed to be built since the beginning of the central business 
district (CBD). The rail line length in year 𝑡 is assumed to be 
𝐿 𝑡 (0 &lt; 𝐿 𝑡 ≤ 𝐵), 𝐵 is the distance between the CBD and 
the city boundary, the number of TOD projects in year 𝑡 is 
represented by 𝑛 𝑡 , 𝑛 𝑡 
𝑠 denotes the number of underground rail 
stations in year 𝑡 (0 &lt; 𝑛 𝑡 
𝑠 ≤ 𝑁, where 𝑁 is a positive integer), 
and 𝑌 𝑡 
𝑖 (∀𝑖 ∈ [1, 𝑛 𝑡 ], 𝑌 𝑡 
𝑖 &gt; 0) is the number of housing units 
in each TOD project 𝑖 in year 𝑡 [9]. 
Due to the limitation of funds and the limited travel 
demand at the initial years of the rail and TOD projects, a 
detailed projects scheme is assumed to be urgently needed. 
The decision variables include rail line length, the number 
of TOD projects, and the number of housing units in each 
TOD project. Since the uncertainties of population densities 
are considered, that is, yearly variation in population density 
in each residential location and CPDRL, the above decision 
variables are stochastic variables in 𝑡. 
The main contribution of this paper includes the follow-
ing: (1) the synergy between rail and TOD projects over years 
is considered. (2) The closed-form solutions for the optimal 
design variables of the rail and TOD projects are given. (3) 
The effects of spatial and temporal correlations of population 
densities on the standard deviation of ROI for the rail and 
TOD projects are explored. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
In Section 2, assumptions are presented with some basic 
considerations of rail and TOD projects. Section 3 proposes 
an investment risk minimization model constrained by a 
required expected ROI. A numerical example is used to 
illustrate the application of the proposed model in Section 4 

together with some insightful findings. Section 5 concludes 
this paper with some suggestions for further investigation. 
Notations used in this paper are listed and defined in the 
Appendix. 

2. Preliminaries 

For the sake of exposition, the following assumptions are 
made. 

(A1) All job opportunities are assumed to be supplied 
in the CBD. Therefore, the residential location-CBD 
commuting trip is a daily compulsory activity. House-
holds are assumed to be homogenous and minimize 
the daily disutility. The daily disutility is assumed to be 
composed of generalized travel cost and daily housing 
rent. Households are assumed to make residential 
location choice by tradeoff between generalized travel 
cost and daily housing rent [5]. 

(A2) The rail and TOD projects are assumed to be finished 
on time, and rail service and housing service can be 
supplied at the end of each period during the design 
time horizon [10, 11]. 

(A3) The rail operator's objective is the investment risk 
minimization of rail and TOD projects with a given 
required expected ROI. This objective can guarantee 
an enough profit measured in the mean value of ROI, 
with the least risk measured in the standard deviation 
of ROI [7, 8]. 

2.1. Investment Risk of Rail and TOD Projects. The investment 
risk analysis of rail and TOD projects is quite necessary, due 
to the huge infrastructure investment requirement of rail 
and TOD projects. ROI is a measure of cash generated or 
lost due to the investment and may be represented by the 
cash flow to the investor from the investment, relative to the 
amount invested. Specifically, it is defined as the ratio of profit 
(whether realized or unrealized) from an investment to the 
amount of money invested. Accordingly, the ROI of candidate 
rail and TOD projects can be calculated by 

ROI 𝑟+TOD = 𝛼ROI 0 + 

𝑛 𝑡 

∑ 

𝑖=1 

𝛼 𝑖 ROI 𝑖 , 
(1) 

where ROI 0 represents ROI of the rail project and ROI 𝑖 (∀𝑖 ∈ 
[1, 𝑛 𝑡 ]) represents ROI of TOD project 𝑖, given by 

ROI 0 =

where PR represents profit from rail project, PT 𝑖 represents 
profit from TOD project 𝑖, 𝐿 𝑡 is rail line length in year 𝑡, 𝐶 𝑟 
is unit fixed construction cost of rail line, 𝑛 𝑡 
𝑠 is rail station

number in year 𝑡, 𝐶 𝑠 is fixed construction cost of each rail 
station, 𝑌 𝑡 
𝑗 is housing unit in TOD project 𝑗 in year 𝑡, and 𝐶 𝑗 
is average fixed cost to construct each housing unit in TOD 𝑗. 
In terms of (1) and (2), ROI 𝑟+TOD is a function of the following 
design variables, including rail line length 𝐿 𝑡 , TOD project 
number 𝑛 𝑡 , and housing unit of each TOD project 𝑌 𝑡 
𝑗 . 
ROI 𝑖 (∀𝑖 ∈ [0, 𝑛 𝑡 ]) is a stochastic variable, which has the 
mean value of 𝐸(ROI 𝑖 ) and the standard deviation of 𝜎(ROI 𝑖 ). 
The covariance between ROI 𝑖 and ROI 𝑗 (∀𝑖, 𝑗 ∈ [0, 𝑛 𝑡 ]) is 
denoted by 𝜎(ROI 𝑖 , ROI 𝑗 ), which are functions of the covari-
ance between population densities in residential locations 
around rail stations 𝑖 and 𝑗. In terms of (1), ROI 𝑟+TOD is also a 
stochastic variable. The mean value of ROI 𝑟+TOD is denoted 
by 𝐸(ROI 𝑟+TOD ), and its standard deviation is denoted by 
𝜎(ROI 𝑟+TOD ). 
Accordingly, 𝛼 and 𝛼 𝑖 in (1) are the investment proportion 
on rail project and each TOD project 𝑖, respectively; namely, 

𝛼 = 
∑ 𝑚 
𝑡=1 (𝐿 𝑡 𝐶 𝑟 + 𝑛 𝑡 
𝑠 𝐶 𝑠 ) 
∑ 𝑚 
𝑡=1 (𝐿 𝑡 𝐶 𝑟 + 𝑛 𝑡

2.2. Profit and Social Welfare of Rail and TOD Projects. The 
profit of the rail project (PR) equals the revenue of fare minus 
relative cost, expressed as

is stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) based pas-
senger travel demand of rail station 𝑖 in year 𝑡, 𝑓 is flat fare of 
rail service for each passenger, 𝑐 is variable operation cost for 
each passenger, 𝐶 𝑟 is unit fixed construction cost of rail line, 
and 𝐶 𝑠 is fixed construction cost of each rail station. 
For the candidate rail and TOD projects, more concerns 
are focused on the increase of social welfare. Consumer 
surplus is a component of social welfare. The consumer 
surplus of the rail project (CSR) is

𝑖 =

𝑖 is generalized travel cost of passengers 
from rail station 𝑖 to the CBD in year 𝑡, 𝑃 𝑡 
𝑖 is population 
density around rail station 𝑖 in year 𝑡, and 𝜃 is a positive 

constant in passenger travel demand function. In terms of (4) 
and (5), the social welfare of the rail project (SWR) is

The profit of TOD project 𝑖 (∀𝑖 ∈ [1, 𝑛 𝑡 ]) (PT 𝑖 ) similarly

𝑖 is daily housing rent of TOD 𝑖 in year 𝑗, 𝑐 𝑖 is the 
variable cost to supply housing service for each passenger, 𝑌 

𝑗 
𝑖 

is housing unit in TOD project 𝑖 in year 𝑗, and 𝐶 𝑖 is the average 
fixed cost to construct each housing unit in TOD 𝑖. 
The consumer surplus of TOD project 𝑖 (∀𝑖 ∈ [1, 𝑛 𝑡 ]) 
(CST 𝑖 ) is calculated by 

CST 𝑖 =

and (𝑃

willingness to pay for housing service of TOD project 𝑖 in year 
𝑗. Then, the social welfare of TOD projects (SWT) is given by 

SWT =

2.3. Stochastic User Equilibrium (SUE) Condition. In terms 
of (A1), households are assumed to choose the residential 
locations to minimize their own disutilities. This disutility is 
assumed to be composed of two parts: generalized travel cost 
and daily housing rent; namely, 

𝑈 𝑡 
𝑖 = 𝜋 𝑡 
𝑖 + 𝑟 𝑡 
𝑖 + 𝜀 𝑡 
𝑖 , (∀𝑖 ∈ [1, 𝑛 𝑡 
𝑠 ] , 𝑡 ∈ [1, 𝑚]) , 
(10) 

where 𝑈 𝑡 
𝑖 is passenger disutility for residential location 
around rail station 𝑖 in year 𝑡, 𝜋 𝑡 
𝑖 is the generalized travel cost 
from rail station 𝑖 to the CBD in year 𝑡, 𝑟 𝑡 
𝑖 is daily housing rent 
in residential location around rail station 𝑖 in year 𝑡, and 𝜀 𝑡 
𝑖 is 
the perception error of generalized travel cost. 
Both generalized travel cost and daily housing rent are 
functions of population density in each residential location.

Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society 

Regarding generalized travel cost function, the Bureau of 
Public Roads (BPR) functions are used in the following 
numerical example. The daily housing rent function should 
satisfy two basic properties: (1) the daily housing rent should 
increase while the total demand for housing service increases 
and (2) the daily housing rent should decrease while the total 
supply of housing service increases. In this paper, the daily 
housing rent in TOD project 𝑖 in year 𝑡, 𝑟 𝑡 
𝑖 , is defined as [12] 

𝑟 𝑡 
𝑖 = 𝜒 0 (1 + 𝜒 1 

𝑃 𝑡 

𝑖 

𝑌 𝑡 

𝑖 

) , (∀𝑖 ∈ [1, 𝑛 𝑡 ] , 𝑡 ∈ [1, 𝑚]) , (11) 

where 𝜒 0 is the base daily housing rent in terms of HKD/unit, 
𝜒 1 is a positive scalar parameter that represents the sensitivity 
of daily housing rent on housing supply and demand, and 𝑌 𝑡 

𝑖 

is the average density of housing units in TOD project 𝑖. For 
those residential locations without TOD projects, the housing 
unit 𝑌𝑜 𝑖 (𝑖 ∈ [1, 𝑛 𝑡 
𝑠 − 𝑛 𝑡 ]) is assumed to be constant over the 
years in planning horizon. The daily housing rent of other 
residential locations, ro 𝑡 
𝑖 , is defined as 

ro 𝑡 
𝑖 = 𝜒𝑜 0 (1 + 𝜒𝑜 1 

𝑃 𝑡 

𝑖 

𝑌𝑜 𝑖 
) , 

(𝑖 ∈ [1, 𝑛 𝑡 
𝑠 − 𝑛 𝑡 ] , 𝑡 ∈ [1, 𝑚]) , 

(12) 

where 𝜒𝑜 0 is the base daily housing rent of other residential 
locations in terms of HKD/unit and 𝜒𝑜 1 is a positive scalar 
parameter of other residential locations which represents 
the sensitivity of daily housing rent on housing supply and 
demand. 
According to the conservation law of population, we have 

𝑛 𝑡 

𝑠 

∑ 

𝑖=1 

𝑃 𝑡 
𝑖 = 𝑃 𝑡 
0 , 
(13) 

where 𝑃 𝑡 
𝑖 is population density in residential locations around 
rail station 𝑖 in year 𝑡 and 𝑃 𝑡 
0 is the total population number 
within the linear monocentric city in year 𝑡. 
Consequently, the stochastic user equilibrium reaches 
the following: no households can reduce his/her perceived 
disutility by unilaterally changing their residential location 
choices. Mathematically, the disutility for households can be 
expressed as 

𝑈 𝑡 
𝑖 = min (𝜋 𝑡 
𝑖 + 

𝑟 𝑡 

𝑖 

𝑟𝑜 𝑡 

𝑖 

+ 
1 
𝜃 
ln 𝑞 𝑡 
𝑖 ) , 

(𝑖 ∈ [1, 𝑛 𝑡 
𝑠 ] , 𝑡 ∈ [1, 𝑚]) , 

(14) 

where 𝑞 𝑡 
𝑖 is the passenger travel demand of rail station 𝑖, 
which is a function of population density in residential 
location around rail station 𝑖, 𝜋 𝑡 
𝑖 is generalized travel cost 
of passengers from rail station 𝑖 to the CBD in year 𝑡, and 
𝜃 is sensitivity parameter in elastic passenger travel demand 
function 𝑞 𝑡 
𝑖 . With an assumption of 𝜀 𝑡 
𝑖 following independent 
and identical Gumbel distribution with mean value of zero, 

a logit-based SUE population distribution could be calculated 
as [13] 

𝑃 𝑡,sue 

𝑖 

= 𝑃 𝑡 

0 

exp (𝜋 𝑡 
𝑖 + 𝑟 𝑡 
𝑖 /𝑟𝑜 𝑡 
𝑖 )

𝑠 

𝑖=1 exp (𝜋 𝑡 
𝑖 + 𝑟 𝑡 
𝑖 /𝑟𝑜 𝑡 
𝑖 ) 

, (𝑡 ∈ [1, 𝑚]) , 
(15) 

where 𝑃 𝑡 
0 is the total population in year 𝑡. 
The passenger travel demand of rail service is assumed to 
be elastic due to sensitivity to the generalized travel cost. An 
exponential demand function is used, shown as follows [14]: 

𝑞 𝑡 
𝑖 = 𝑃 𝑡 
𝑖 exp (−𝜃 (𝜋 𝑡 
𝑖 + 𝜀 𝑡 
𝑖 )) , 

(𝑖 ∈ [1, 𝑛 𝑡 
𝑠 ] , 𝑡 ∈ [1, 𝑚]) , 

(16) 

where 𝜃 is a positive constant and 𝜀 𝑡 
𝑖 is the perception error of 
generalized travel cost. 

3. Model Formulation 

The rail operator of rail and TOD projects is assumed to 
minimize the investment risk for a given required expected 
ROI that they are willing to earn. The investment risk could 
be measured by standard deviation of ROI [7]. The greater 
the standard deviation is, the greater the risk is. Specifically, 
the objective of the rail operator is to minimize standard 
deviation of ROI by available capital allocation. An alternative 
way is to examine the following investment portfolio question 
with the consideration of two assets: one risk-free asset which 
has a low ROI but no risk and another risky asset that has a 
higher expected ROI for a higher risk. By varying a relative 
proportion of the two assets, a ROI tradeoff can be selected, 
and correspondingly available capital can be allocated [15, 16]. 

3.1. Expected ROI Constrained Investment Risk Minimization 
Model. The expected ROI constrained investment risk mini-
mization model can be formulated as follows: 

Minimize 𝜎 (ROI)

Denote 𝜔 −1 = 𝛽,𝜔 0 = 𝛼(1 − 𝛽), and 𝜔 𝑖 = (1 − 𝛽)𝛼 𝑖 , 
∀𝑖 ∈ [1, 𝑛 𝑡 ]. Given a mean value of 𝐸(ROI) and 𝑟 𝑓 , since

Let V 𝑖 = 𝜆𝜔 𝑖 , and then, in terms of Karush-Kuhn-
Tucker conditions, V 𝑖 satisfies the following system of linear 
equations: 

𝑛 𝑡 

∑ 

𝑗=0 

𝜎 (ROI 𝑖 , ROI 𝑗 ) V 𝑗 = 𝐸 (ROI 𝑖 ) − 𝑟 𝑓 , ∀𝑖 ∈ [0,𝑛 𝑡 ] . (19) 

Finally, 𝜔 𝑖 could be calculated by 

𝜔 𝑖 =

(20) 

Given an expected mean value of ROI 𝐸(ROI) and risk-
free asset 𝑟 𝑓 , the optimal investment proportions 𝜔 𝑖 on 
rail and each TOD project, with respect to the objective 
of investment risk minimization, are unique, which is the 
solution of linear equations system of (19) and normalization 
calculation of (20) [7]. 

3.2. Closed-Form Solutions for Decision Variables of Rail and 
TOD Projects. The social welfare maximization over years for 
rail and TOD projects can be formulated as

Based on (19) and (20), the optimal investment propor-
tions under investment risk minimization equation (17a)-
(17e) for the optimal rail and TOD projects with respect to 
the objective of social welfare equation (21) are unique. 

4. Numerical Example 

A small tractable network is chosen for the test. It consists of 
four links, 1, 2, 3, and 4, and four residential locations, central 
business district (CBD), suburban community, TOD 1, and 
TOD 2, as shown in Figure 2. Rail exists between the CBD 
and the suburban community. This rail is extended from the 
suburban community to TOD 2. Meanwhile, TOD 1 and TOD 
2 are developed by the rail operator as an indirect subsidy. 
The Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) travel time function is 
employed to define the travel cost, shown as follows: 

𝐸 (𝜋 𝑡 
𝑖 ) = 𝜇𝑡 0 
𝑖 + 𝛾𝑡 0 
𝑖 (0.15 (

∀𝑖 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 

(23) 

where 𝑡 0 
𝑖 is the travel time on link 𝑖 by rail in year 𝑡, 𝜇 is the 
value of time, 𝛾 is the parameter for rail crowding, and 𝑆 𝑡

population density in each residential location in the initial 
year are given as follows [17]: 

𝐸 (𝑃 1 
1 ) = 5000 (persons), 

𝐸 (𝑃 1

𝐸 (𝑃 1

(24) 

Coefficient of variation (CV) is equal to the mean divided 
by variance. It is assumed in this example the CV of all the 
population is constant and set as 0.3. The following housing 
rent functions are adopted for this example: 

𝐸 (𝑟 𝑡 
𝑖 ) = 𝜒 0 (1 + 𝜒 1

𝜒𝑜 0 = 12 (HK$/day), 𝜒 1 = 12, 𝜒𝑜 1 = 12, 𝑌 1 
1 = 6500 units, 
𝑌 1 
2 = 15000 units, and 𝑌 1 
3 = 𝑌 1 
4 = 20000 units. The other 
relevant input data of this example are the same as the nota-
tions values in the Notations. 
The standard deviation of ROI without temporal and 
spatial covariance is also plotted in Figure 3; namely, minimal 
value line 𝜎(ROI) = 0. It is safe to conclude that investment 
risk is substantially underestimated without consideration of 
yearly variation of population densities. 
Figure 3 presents the notion that the standard deviation of 
ROI, 𝜎(ROI), will be 0, if no spatial and temporal covariance 
were considered. 𝜎(ROI) will also be 0 when the temporal 
covariance coefficient is 0, whereas it is positive as spatial

covariance increases from 0 to 1. 𝜎(ROI) increases as the 
population growth factor of total population increases from 
0.2 to 0.4. The maximal value point of 𝜎(ROI) is 5.00 for 
population growth factor 0.4. The difference of 𝜎(ROI) under 
population growth factors 0.2 and 0.4, Δ𝜎(ROI), is 2.28, 
with respect to temporal covariance coefficient 1 and spatial 
covariance coefficient 0. 
The mean ROI values of each candidate project are shown 
in Table 1. From this table, one can observe that 𝐸(ROI 𝑖 ) 0.2 of 
rail, TOD 1, and TOD 2 are higher under scenario S1 (with-
out consideration of spatial and temporal CC) than under 
the other scenarios (from S2 to S9). Thus, overestimation 
of investment risks exists without consideration of either 
temporal CC or spatial CC for population growth factor 0.2. 
Huge investment is required for the rail project. It could be 
seen that the ROI of rail is far less than the risk-free asset, 
while the ROIs of TOD projects are more than the risk-free 
asset. For example, under S1 with population growth factor of

0.4, the mean ROI value of rail is 0.6%, whereas those of TOD 
1 and TOD 2 are 12.85% and 3.75%. 

5. Concluding Remarks 

This paper proposes an integrated model to optimize simul-
taneously the decision variables of rail and TOD projects 
over years in a linear monocentric city. This model explicitly 
considers the effects of the yearly variation in population 
density and the correlation of spatial and temporal popu-
lation densities on the return on investment (ROI) of the 
rail and TOD projects. It is found that the ROI of rail and 
TOD projects may be underestimated without consideration 
of yearly variation in population density and correlation of 
spatial and population densities. The TOD projects 
can greatly improve the financial feasibility of rail project and 
increase the rail project attraction for a revenue-driven rail 
operator. 
Further research can be conducted in the following 
directions: 

(i) In this paper, a linear monocentric city is used with 
only one CBD and several residential TOD locations. 
The city boundary is not explicitly considered. It is 
necessary to elaborate the city boundary so as to 
extend to a polycentric city model. 

(ii) All households are assumed to be homogenous and 
only commute from residential locations to the CBD 
in this paper. However, previous studies have shown 
that income levels may dominate the residential loca-
tion choice (see, e.g., [18, 19]). Therefore, the model 
can be extended to incorporate the income level for 
determining residential locations. 

(iii) The investment risk comes from yearly variation in 
population density and correlation of spatial and 
temporal population densities in this paper. However, 
there are also many other typical investment risks. It 
is worthwhile to develop more detailed models in this 
directions.

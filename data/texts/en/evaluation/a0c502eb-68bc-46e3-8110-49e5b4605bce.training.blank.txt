Nanocrystalline ZnO:Al nanoparticles are suitable building blocks for transparent conductive layers. As the concentration of 
substitutional tetrahedral Al is an important factor for improving conductivity, here we aim to increase the fraction of substitutional 
Al. To this end, synthesis parameters of a solvothermal reaction yielding ZnO:Al nanorods were varied. A unique set of 
complementary techniques was combined to reveal the exact position of the aluminium ions in the ZnO lattice and demonstrated its 
importance in order to evaluate the potential of ZnO:Al nanocrystals as optimal building blocks for solution deposited transparent 
conductive oxide layers. Both an extension of the solvothermal reaction time and stirring during solvothermal treatment result in a 
higher total tetrahedral aluminium content in the ZnO lattice. However, only the longer solvothermal treatment effectively results 
in an increase of the substitutional positions aimed for. 

1. Introduction 

Because of the coexistence of high conductivity and high 
transparency in the visible region, the realization of trans-
parent conductive oxides (TCOs) has attracted much interest 
for optoelectronic device applications, such as solar cells and 
displays [1-3]. Among all TCOs, Al-doped ZnO (ZnO:Al) has 
gained considerable and continuous interest as it represents 
a lower-cost, earth-abundant alternative to the widely used 
TCO indium tin oxide (ITO) [4]. At the same time, TCO 
nanocrystals (NCs) have recently drawn attention because 
of their low cost associated with the possibility of solution 
processing and the potential to exploit their size-dependent 
properties [5]. Deposition of colloidal TCO NCs as a nanoink 
is highly appealing for integration into emerging flexible 

electronics, such as displays, electronic paper, or solar cells 
[6, 7]. While the synthesis of ZnO:Al nanocrystals and 
films has recently advanced markedly, it still remains a 
challenge to control dopant incorporation in zinc oxide based 
TCO NCs [8-16]. Even more, probing doping efficiency and 
understanding whether or not dopants have substituted the 
desired host atoms are not trivial. No single analytical tool 
is fully satisfactory in this regard. Instead, an appropriate 
combination of characterization techniques can give more 
reliable insights. Identifying, understanding and ultimately 
controlling the uptake, dopant content and dopant location 
in inorganic nanostructures is as an important goal. First, the 
overall solubility limit of Al in the ZnO lattice is rather low. 
The thermodynamic solubility limit of Al in ZnO thin films 
is in the range of 1-2%. An experimental solubility limit has

been estimated under 0.3 at% of Al using X-ray diffraction 
refinements, whereas NMR analyses lead rather to a limit well 
below 0.1 at% [17, 18]. Furthermore, it is believed that only 
when the dopants occupy substitutional tetrahedral sites in 
the ZnO crystal lattice, shallow donor levels are created which 
allow promotion of free carriers into the conduction band 
[19-21]. Besides the substitutional tetrahedral position, the 
aluminium ions can also occupy empty interstitial tetrahedral 
and octahedral sites in the hexagonal wurtzite structure of 
ZnO. In these positions however, they will act as an acceptor, 
hence decreasing the conductivity [18, 20, 22]. 
Previous work [23] demonstrated the existence of a 
constant, synthesis-dependent solubility limit for tetrahedral 
aluminium in two series of ZnO:Al nanoparticles. For the 
nanoequiaxed particles 0.25 at% of Al is placed in tetrahedral 
positions, which is five times higher compared with the 
nanorod particles, where only 0.05 at% of Al is placed in 
tetrahedral positions. The aim of the work presented in this 
paper is to study the synthesis parameters in order to increase 
the tetrahedral aluminium content in the nanorods. More 
specifically, the substitutional tetrahedral aluminium con-
tent, accountable for the increased conductivity, is targeted. 

2. Experimental 

2.1. Materials. Zinc acetylacetonate hydrate Zn(acac) 2 ⋅xH 2 O 
(Sigma-Aldrich), aluminium acetylacetonate Al(acac) 3 (99%, 
Sigma-Aldrich), and benzyl alcohol C 6 H 5 CH 2 OH (99%, 
Alfa Aesar) are used as received. The amount of hydrate 
water (x) in the zinc acetylacetonate hydrate is verified by 
high-resolution thermogravimetric analysis (HR-TGA) and 
inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy 
(ICP-AES) to be 1 per formula unit. 

2.2. Synthesis of the ZnO:Al Nanorods. A mixture of 1 g 
Zn(acac) 2 ⋅1H 2 O, 0.057 g Al(acac) 3 (0.5 mol% with respect to 
Zn), and 40 mL benzyl alcohol is stirred for 30 minutes in 
a Teflon liner (inner volume of 80 mL). This Teflon liner is 
then transferred into a stainless steel vessel which is sealed 
and placed in a preheated furnace at 200 ∘ C for 6 h. After 
cooling down to room temperature, the resulting precipitate 
is centrifuged (4400 rpm, 45 󸀠 ), washed (with methanol and 
milliQ water), and dried [23]. As a variation in synthesis 
parameters, the time the autoclave stays in the furnace is 
extended to 48 h and 96 h, respectively. Another variation in 
the synthesis parameters is the use of a solvothermal reactor 
(PARR 5500 series compact reactor) with stirring option 
instead of a furnace to treat the reaction mixture. 

2.3. Characterization. The crystal phase of the dry nanopow-
ders was determined at room temperature by X-ray diffrac-
tion (XRD) in the 2𝜃 range from 10 to 60 ∘ , using a Siemens 
D-5000 diffractometer with Cu K𝛼1 radiation. The size and 
morphology of the ZnO(:Al) nanocrystals were characterized 
with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), carried out on 
a FEI Tecnai Spirit at an acceleration voltage of 120 kV. For 
this purpose, a small drop of powdered sample redispersed 
in methanol was deposited on a carbon-film coated copper 

grid and dried under an infrared lamp. The structure of 
the nanocrystals at the atomic scale was characterized using 
high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) 
performed on a Fei Tecnai G2, operated at 200 kV. Samples 
for HR-TEM were prepared by redispersing the powder in 
ethanol using an ultrasonic bath for 10 minutes and then 
depositing a few drops of this dispersion onto a holey carbon 
grid. 
The 27 Al solid-state magic angle spinning nuclear mag-
netic resonance (MAS-NMR) measurements were performed 
at room temperature on an Agilent VNMRS 400 MHz spec-
trometer (9.4 𝑇 wide bore magnet) equipped with a Varian-
Chemagnetics T3HX 3.2 mm probe. The resonance frequency 
of the aluminum nuclei is 104.22 MHz. The samples were 
packed into a 3.2 mm zirconia rotor and sealed with tight 
fitting Torlon caps. The spectra were obtained at a rotor 
spinning rate of 18 kHz by using a single pulse experiment 
with a 𝜋/2 pulse of 4.2 𝜇s, an acquisition time of 10 ms, a 
preparation delay of 6 s, and a spectral width of 100 kHz. The 
number of accumulations was around 20000. The chemical 
shift scale, in parts per million (ppm), was externally refer-
enced to AlCl 3 ⋅6H 2 O at 0 ppm. The aluminum 𝑇 1 relaxation 
decay times were measured on the same spectrometer via the 
inversion recovery method in which the evolution time 𝑡 (19 
values) was varied between 0.5 ms and 30 s. The repetition 
delay was set to 20 s and about 900 scans were accumu-
lated. The integrated signal intensity 𝐼(𝑡) of the tetrahedral 
resonance was analyzed biexponentially as a function of the 
variable recovery time 𝑡 according to

The superscripts 𝑆 and 𝐿 refer to the fractions with short and 
long decay time, respectively. 
Transmission Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra 
were recorded at room temperature using a Vertex 70 FTIR 
spectrometer from Bruker Optics. The transmittance of KBr-
pellets containing 0.5 wt% ZnO:(Al) was measured in the 
wavenumber interval of 4000-400 cm −1 . The resolution of 
the spectra is 4 cm −1 . 
A resonant microwave cavity perturbation method was 
used to measure the microwave conductivity of the powders 
[24]. Low dielectric loss quartz tubes (1.6 mm inner diameter) 
containing powder samples were inserted axially into an 
aluminum TM 010 mode cylindrical resonant cavity. The 
cavity has a height of 40 mm and a 46 mm radius, with 
a corresponding operating frequency of 2.45 GHz and an 
unloaded quality factor of over 8000. S 21 measurements 
were taken using an Agilent E5071B vector network analyzer. 
Further experimental details are described in [25].

Figure 1: XRD patterns of Al-doped ZnO nanocrystalline rods 
as a function of the solvothermal reaction time and presence of 
solvothermal stirring (6 h at 200 ∘ C). 

6 h, 48 h, and 96 h at 200 ∘ C without stirring and solvother-
mally treated for 6 h at 200 ∘ C with stirring, the peaks are 
identified as (100), (002), (101), (102), and (110) reflections of 
the hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO (JCPDS 36-1451), 
confirming that all the ZnO:Al nanocrystals retain the similar 
ZnO structure. The sharp signal at 32.9 ∘ in the pattern after 
stirring originates from the Si sample holder. 
TEM characterization (Figure 2) reveals that despite 
the extension of the reaction time or stirring during 
the solvothermal treatment, the morphology of the 
crystalline Al-doped ZnO nanorods does not change. 
Possible differences in the position of the aluminium ion 
in the ZnO lattice can be evaluated by means of 27 Al-NMR 
measurements (Figure 3), from which it is possible to distin-
guish between tetrahedral (75 ± 15 ppm [26]) and octahedral 
(0-20 ppm [26]) coordination of aluminium. Both the 
signal corresponding to aluminium in a 4-fold coordination 
with oxygen (tetrahedral) and the signal corresponding to 
aluminium in a 6-fold coordination with oxygen (octahedral) 
have a rather sharp line shape, indicating that the Al resides 
in a highly ordered, symmetrical crystalline environment. 
The absence of broad resonance signals, observed by 
Kemmitt et al. [20], indicates that no amorphous phase 
of Al-doped ZnO is present. The spectra clearly reveal an 
increase in tetrahedral aluminium content as a function of 
the solvothermal reaction time. Associated with an extension 
of the solvothermal treatment time from 6 h to, respectively, 
48 h and 96 h, the tetrahedral aluminium fraction increases 
from 15% (Figure 3(a)) to, respectively, 27% (Figure 3(b)) and 
31% (Figure 3(c)). However, by stirring the reaction mixture 
during the solvothermal treatment (6 h), this tetrahedral 
fraction even increases up to 41% (Figure 3(d)). Although 
the spectra show a significant increase of the tetrahedral 
aluminium content, this is not necessarily associated with 
a higher amount of the desired tetrahedral substitutional 

aluminium, leading to an increased conductivity as 4-fold 
coordinated aluminium can appear in substitutional as well 
as interstitial positions in the ZnO lattice. To obtain more 
detailed information regarding this distribution, FTIR is used 
as a complementary technique. FTIR is able to detect surface 
plasmon resonance effects due to the presence of free charge 
carriers, providing an indirect proof for substitutional doping 
[27-29]. The spectrum (Figure 4) of the ZnO:Al nanorods 
(0.5% Al) that were solvothermally treated for 6 h exhibits the 
same features as the spectrum of ordinary ZnO. The broad 
absorption bands at ∼3430 cm −1 and ∼1645 cm −1 encompass 
the O-H stretching vibrations of adsorbed water on the 
ZnO:Al surface while the strong absorption band between 
500 and 400 cm −1 can be attributed to the stretching modes 
of Zn-O and/or Al-O. The spectra of the ZnO:Al nanorods 
obtained after longer solvothermal reaction times (48 h and 
96 h) on the other hand exhibit a broad additional absorption 
band between 600 and 3000 cm −1 which can be attributed to 
surface plasmon IR absorptions originating from free charge 
carriers. It is clear that longer solvothermal treatments lead to 
more pronounced plasmon resonance absorptions, which in 
turn can be related to a higher charge carrier concentration in 
these particles [30, 31]. It is assumed that only substitutional 
Al contributes to the formation of charge carriers. This leads 
to the conclusion that a longer solvothermal reaction time 
leads to a higher content of substitutional aluminium, which 
should be beneficial for the conductivity [20, 21]. In contrast 
to these findings, the even higher content of tetrahedral 
aluminium obtained by stirring during solvothermal 
treatment does not result in more free charge carriers. The 
relatively high (41%) content of tetrahedral aluminium 
as determined by 27 Al-NMR (Figure 3(d)) is clearly not 
correlated to an increase of free charge carriers as no distinct 
plasma resonance IR absorption is observed (Figure 4). The 
coexistence of high tetrahedral aluminium content and a 
low number of free charge carriers indicates that most of the 
aluminium ions have to be located in interstitial tetrahedral 
positions. A possible explanation might be a conflict between 
thermodynamics and kinetics; that is, stirring promotes 
the tetrahedral aluminium incorporation but the limited 
reaction time of 6 h does not allow reaching thermodynamic 
equilibrium. Further, the different setups (autoclave in 
furnace and solvothermal reactor) might result in a different 
heating profile and probably different heating rate, which 
could also influence the dopant position [20]. 
In addition to FTIR characterization, relative conduc-
tivity values were determined for the different powders by 
microwave resonant perturbation measurements. By placing 
the sample in a resonant microwave electric field, the shift 
in resonant bandwidth ΔBW can be directly related to the 
conductivity of the powders since the imaginary part of 
the permittivity 𝜀 󸀠󸀠 is dominated by the conductivity 𝜎 for 
conductive samples according to 𝜀 󸀠󸀠 = 𝜎/𝜀 0 𝜔, where 𝜀 0 is the 
permittivity of free space and 𝜔 is the angular frequency. The 
measured ΔBW is proportional to 𝜀 󸀠󸀠 and thus to 𝜎 for a 
given frequency. Although this technique does not provide 
the absolute value of the electrical conductivity, it allows us 
to rank different ZnO:Al particle samples according to their

electrical conductivity. Effective medium theory may be used 
to infer the absolute dielectric properties of powders, though 
here the measured "effective" values indicate the relative 
conductivity of each powder. The microwave absorption data 
(Figure 5) show a significant increase in ΔBW or electrical 
conductivity for longer solvothermal treatments, supporting 
the FTIR data which indicated a higher number of free 
charge carriers. On the other hand, the ZnO:Al nanocrystals 
obtained by stirring during the solvothermal treatment do 
not exhibit a significant increase in electrical conductivity, 
also in accordance with the lack of a surface plasmon 
absorption signal in the FTIR spectrum. 
The indirect indications for the exact aluminium 
position, determined by FTIR and microwave absorption 
measurements, were ultimately confirmed by evaluating 

the 𝑇 1 spin-lattice relaxation decay time behavior of the 
tetrahedral Al (signal at ±80 ppm). Based on the 27 Al-NMR 
spectra (Figure 3) a first distinction between aluminium 
in an octahedral or tetrahedral coordination with oxygen 
could be made. By focusing now on the tetrahedral signal 
and monitoring the 𝑇 1 spin-lattice relaxation decay time 
of this signal, one can distinguish between aluminium in 
differently ordered tetrahedral environments. For ZnO:Al 
nanocrystals which were solvothermally treated for 96 h as 
well as for ZnO:Al nanocrystals obtained by stirring during 
their 6 h solvothermal treatment, two 27 Al spin populations 
(fractions) with a different 𝑇 1 relaxation decay time were 
observed (Table 1), indicating the existence of two different 
tetrahedral environments.

Figure 4: FT-IR spectra of the different ZnO:Al nanorods. 

For the nanorods obtained after a 96 h solvothermal 
treatment, 77% of the tetrahedral aluminium has a long 
spin-lattice relaxation time of ±0.8 s against 66% (𝑇 1 = 
±0.7 s) in the ZnO:Al nanorods obtained by stirring during 
solvothermal treatment. In general, sharp signals in the 27 Al-
NMR spectrum, corresponding with aluminium located in a 
highly ordered, symmetrical crystalline environment, exhibit 
relatively long spin-lattice relaxation times. Following this 
trend, the relatively long 𝑇 1 decay time (or slow spin-lattice 
relaxation rate) is associated with tetrahedral aluminium in 

substitutional positions [32, 33]. The higher fraction of tetra-
hedral substitutional aluminium in the ZnO:Al nanorods 
which were obtained after treatment for 96 h at 200 ∘ C 
supports the indirect indications obtained from the FTIR and 
microwave absorption measurements. Regarding the short 𝑇 1 
spin-lattice relaxation time of the tetrahedral signal, 23% of 
the tetrahedral Al in the rods obtained after a solvothermal 
treatment of 96 h at 200 ∘ C has a 𝑇 1 = 4.6 ms while 34% of 
the tetrahedral Al in the rods obtained after solvothermal 
treatment while stirring (6 h) has a 𝑇 1 of 24.8 ms. The 𝑇 1

decay times are different in almost one order of magnitude 
(4.6 ms against 24.8 ms). If this difference is significant, it 
might suggest the existence of two different Al-positions of 
which the origin is still not clear. Avadhut et al. [33] reported 
about a core-shell structure with substitutional aluminium 
in the ZnO crystalline core and a shell or secondary-
phase containing amorphous tetrahedral aluminium. How-
ever, an amorphous environment is not expected here, as 
the signals in the Al-NMR spectra are sharp. HR-TEM 
images indeed confirm that the nanocrystals consist of a 
single phase up to the edge of the crystals (Figure 6). No 
indications are observed consistent with an amorphous shell 
nor do the Fourier transforms of the images show any 
differences between the edge and the middle regions of the 
nanocrystals. Combining the information obtained by 27 Al-
NMR spectroscopy and 𝑇 1 -relaxometry suggests the key role 
importance of the ratio between substitutional and interstitial 
tetrahedral aluminium. While spectroscopy demonstrates a 
tetrahedral content of 31% versus 41% for ZnO:Al nanorods 

obtained by solvothermal treatment at 200 ∘ C for 96 h and for 
6 h with stirring, respectively, the 𝑇 1 -results indicate a larger 
amount of substitutional Al for the former (77% versus 66%). 
Table 2 displays the ratio of substitutional/interstitial tetrahe-
dral aluminium for the two ways of synthesis. Normalization 
to the interstitial tetrahedral fraction results in 3.4 substi-
tutional aluminium ions for each interstitial aluminium ion 
for nanorods obtained by solvothermal treatment for 96 h at 
200 ∘ C in contrast to only 1.9 for a solvothermal treatment for 
6 h at 200 ∘ C with stirring. Based on this ratio, it becomes clear 
that a prolongation of the solvothermal reaction time yields 
the best conditions to enhance conductivity. Indeed, while 
substitutional aluminium improves the conductivity, intersti-
tial aluminium has a negative effect on the conductivity.

treatment results in an increase of the tetrahedral aluminium 
fraction in the resulting ZnO nanocrystalline rods. Fur-
thermore, the appearance of a plasmon absorption signal 
(FTIR spectra) due to the presence of free charge carriers 
and the significant increase in conductivity (microwave 
absorption measurements) for ZnO:Al nanocrystals that 
were solvothermally treated for longer reaction times (48 h 
and 96 h) suggests an increase of the tetrahedral aluminium 
in substitutional positions. The lack of a plasmon absorption 
signal and of a significant increase in conductivity for the 
ZnO:Al nanocrystals prepared by stirring during a short 
solvothermal reaction time of 6 h suggests that the increase 
in the tetrahedral aluminium fraction is not associated with 
an increase in substitutional aluminium in these crystals. 
Additionally, the 𝑇 1 spin-lattice relaxation time behavior of 
the tetrahedral signal shows a 77% contribution of sub-
stitutional tetrahedral aluminium in the ZnO:Al nanorods 
obtained by 96 h solvothermal treatment as compared to a 
66% contribution of substitutional tetrahedral aluminium in 
the ZnO:Al nanorods obtained by stirring during the 6 h 
solvothermal treatment. 
It can be concluded that the substitutional tetrahedral 
aluminium fraction can be successfully increased by extend-
ing the duration of the solvothermal treatment. The ZnO:Al 
nanorods solvothermally treated for 96 h exhibited the largest 
proportion of substitutional tetrahedral aluminium, making 
this the most promising route for further studies. Further-
more, it is demonstrated that, by employing the unique 
combination of complementary techniques used in this study, 
the exact position of aluminium in the ZnO lattice can be 
determined, allowing to make predictions toward the best 
building blocks for transparent conductive layers.

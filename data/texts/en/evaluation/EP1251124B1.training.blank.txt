Description 

TECHNICAL FIELD 

[0001] The present invention relates to a process for preparing a quinolylpropenal derivative from a quinolylacrylonitrile 
derivative. The quinolylpropenal derivative prepared by the method of the invention is utilizable as an intermediate 
compound for the synthesis of a cholesterol reducing agent (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor). 

BACKGROUND ART 

[0002] Until now, it has been known that the quinolylpropenal derivative is prepared by the two step process comprising 
a step of reducing a quinoline acrylate by diisobutylaluminum hydride to give quinolylpropenol and a subsequent step 
of oxidizing the quinolylpropenol by the use of a combination of oxalyl chloride and dimethylsulfoxide, or manganese 
dioxide (J. Med. Chem., 34, 367 (1991)). 
[0003] Further known is a method of selectively reducing the cyano group to a formyl group by the use of a diisobuty-
laluminum hydride reducing agent, keeping the double bond of an acrylonitrile compound to produce a propenal compound 
(Heterocycles, 29, 691 (1989)). 
[0004] Both of the above-mentioned process and method are disadvantageous from the viewpoint of industrial prep-
aration because these process and method utilize diisobutylaluminum hydride or manganese dioxide which requires 
careful handling procedures and complicated post-treatment. 

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION 

[0005] The present invention resides in a method for preparing 3-[2-cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-quinolyl]-prop-
2-enal by reducing 3-[2-cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-quinolyl] prop-2-enenitrile using Raney-nickel in the presence 
of formic acid and water in an amount of 0.25 to 1 volume part per one volume part of the formic acid, or in the presence 
of an amine salt of formic acid and an organic acid. 
[0006] The starting compound of the reaction of the invention, that is, 3-[2-cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-quinolyl] 
prop-2-enenitrile [hereinafter referred to as quinolylacrylonitrile derivative] and the desired compound, that is, 3-[2-
cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-quinolyl] prop-2-enal [hereinafter referred to as quinolylpropenal derivative] are the com-
pounds represented, respectively, by the following formulas (1) and (2): 

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 

[0007] The quinolylacrylonitrile derivative of the formula (1) which is the starting material of the reaction of the invention 
is new and can be prepared by reacting a known 2-cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl) quinoline-3-carbaldehyde (which is 
described in JP-A-279866, EP-A-304063, and USP 5,011,930) with diethyl cyanomethylphosphonate, preferably in such 
as solvent as an aromatic hydrocarbon in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide. 
[0008] The Raney-nickel which is employed in the reductive reaction of the invention is an alloy comprising nickel and 
aluminum as principle ingredients. The nickel content preferably is in the range of 10 to 90 wt. %, more preferably 40 to 
80 wt. %. Generally, an activated Raney-nickel is employed. However, Raney-nickels which are pre-treated or stabilized 
by various methods can be also employed. The Raney-nickel can further comprise other metals such as cobalt, iron, 
lead, chromium, titan, molybdenum, vanadium, manganese, tin, and tungsten. 
[0009] In the reducing reaction of the invention, the Raney-nickel is employed in an amount of preferably 0.30 to 2 
weight parts in terms of weight of nickel atom, more preferably 0.30 to 1.2 weight parts, per one weight part of the starting 
compound (i.e., quinolylacrylonitrile derivative) . 
[0010] In one embodiment of the reducing reaction using Raney-nickel can be performed in the presence of formic 


EP 1 251 124 B1

acid and water in an amount of 0.25 to 1 volume part per one volume part of the formic acid. 
[0011] According to the study of the present inventors, it has been confirmed that the desired quinolylpropenal derivative 
of the aforementioned formula (2) can be obtained in a high yield and under easily controllable reaction conditions if the 
water is used in an amount of the above-mentioned range. 
[0012] The formic acid is employed in an amount of preferably 0.25 to 50 weight parts, more preferably 1 to 40 weight 
parts, per one weight part of the quinolylacrylonitrile (starting compound). 
[0013] When the reducing reaction is carried out, solvents other than formic acid and water can be present in the 
reaction mixture. There are no specific limitations with respect to the solvents, provided that the solvents do not disturb 
the reaction. Examples of the solvents include amides such as N, N-dimethylformamide; alcohols such as methanol, 
ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, and t-butyl alcohol; ketones such as acetone and methyl ethyl ketone; aliphatic hydrocarbons 
such as pentane and cyclohexane; and aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene. 
[0014] If the above-mentioned solvent is employed in the reducing reaction, the solvent is employed in an amount of 
generally, not more than 60 weight parts, particularly not more than 10 weight parts, per one weight part of the quinoly-
lacrylonitrile derivative (starting compound). The solvents can be employed singly or in combination. 
[0015] The reducing reaction can be performed by causing formic acid and water into contact with the quinolylacry-
lonitrile derivative in a liquid phase in the presence of Raney-nickel. For instance, the reaction can be carried out by 
heating and stirring a mixture of the Raney-nickel, quinolylacrylonitrile derivative, formic acid and water at an atmospheric 
pressure or increased pressure under inert gas atmosphere. The reaction is performed at a temperature of preferably 
20 to 110°C, more preferably 30 to 80°C. The reaction can be controlled, if desired, by addition of an inorganic base, 
an organic base, or a platinum salt to the reaction mixture, as described on pages 123-147 of "Raney Catalysts", Teruo 
Kubomatu and Shinichiro Komatsu, published by Kawaken Fine Chemicals Co., Ltd. 
[0016] The reaction product (target product) of the reaction of the invention, that is, the quinolylpropenal derivative of 
the formula (2) can be isolated and purified after the reaction and subsequent filtration and extraction are complete, by 
a conventional procedure such as distillation, recrystallization, or column chromatography. 
[0017] Another embodiment of the reducing reaction using Raney-nickel according to the present invention can be 
performed in the presence of an amine salt of formic acid and an organic acid. 
[0018] The amine salt of formic acid is a salt formed of formic acid and an amine. Examples include ammonium 
formate; salts of formic acid with a primary amine such as monomethylammonium formate and monoethylammonium 
formate; salts of formic acid with a secondary amine such as dimethylammonium formate and diethylammonium formate; 
and salts of formic acid with a tertiary amine such as trimethylammonium formate and triethylammonium formate. Pre-
ferred are ammonium formate and triethylammonium formate. More preferred is ammonium formate. The amine salt of 
formic acid is employed in an amount of preferably 1.0 to 5.0 moles, more preferably 1.5 to 3.0 moles, per one mole of 
the quinolylacrylonitrile derivative (starting compound). 
[0019] The organic acid preferably is a lower aliphatic acid having 2 to 5 carbon atoms. Examples are acetic acid, 
propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid, isovaleric acid and pivalic acid. Preferred is acetic acid. The 
organic acid is employed in an amount of preferably 3 to 50 weight parts, more preferably 5 to 30 weight parts, per one 
weight part of the quinolylacrylonitrile derivative (starting compound). The organic acids can be employed singly or in 
combination. 
[0020] The reducing reaction can be preferably performed by causing the quinolylacrylonitrile derivative of the formula 
(1) into contact with the amine salt of formic acid in an organic acid in the presence of Raney-nickel. For instance, the 
reaction can be carried out by heating and stirring a mixture of the Raney-nickel, quinolylacrylonitrile derivative, ammonium 
formate and an organic acid at an atmospheric pressure or increased pressure under inert gas atmosphere. The reaction 
is performed at a temperature of preferably 20 to 110°C, more preferably 40 to 90°C. The reaction can be controlled, if 
desired, by addition of an inorganic base, an organic base, or a platinum salt to the reaction mixture, as described on 
pages 123-147 of "Raney Catalysts", Teruo Kubomatu and Shinichiro Komatsu, published by Kawaken Fine Chemicals 
Co., Ltd. . 
[0021] The reaction product (target product) of the reaction of the invention, that is, the quinolylpropenal derivative of 
the formula (2) can be isolated and purified after the reaction and subsequent filtration and extraction are complete, by 
a conventional procedure such as distillation, recrystallization, or column chromatography. 

[Reference Example 1] Preparation of 3-[2-cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-quinolyl] prop-2-enenitrile 

[0022] In a 100 mL-volume glass flask equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer and a dropping funnel were placed

98%) was added, and the mixture was reacted for 66 hours at the same temperature. After the reaction was complete, 
5 mL of water was added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes. To the mixture was added 
50 mL of toluene, and the organic portion is taken out. The organic portion was washed with 10 mL of an aqueous 
sodium hydroxide solution (10 wt. %), and to the washed portion was added 10 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride 
solution. The aqueous mixture was neutralized by addition of 5.6 mL of hydrochloric acid (1 mol/L), and the organic 
portion was taken out. The organic portion was placed in a 200 mL-volume glass flask equipped with a stirrer. To the 
organic portion was added 1.60 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the mixture was stirred for one hour at room 
temperature. To the mixture were further added 0.14 g of active carbon (powder, available from Wako Junyaku Co., 
Ltd.) and 0.62 g of silica gel (Wakogel C-200, available from Wako Junyaku Co., Ltd.). The mixture was then stirred for 
1.75 hours at room temperature, and filtered through a celite. The celite was washed with 50 mL of toluene. The reaction 
liquid was concentrated under reduced pressure to precipitate a crystalline product. The crystalline product was heated 
to melt, and after addition of 30 mL of hexane, heated under reflux for 30 minutes. Thereafter, the liquid was chilled to 
5°C, and stirred for 2 hours to precipitate a crystalline product. The crystalline product was collected by filtration, washed 
with 30 mL of hexane, and dried at 55°C under reduced pressure, to obtain 4.81 g (yield 90%) of 3-[2-cyclopropyl-4-(4-
fluorophenyl)-3-quinolyl] prop-2-enenitrile as a white crystalline product. 
[0023] The obtained 3-[2-cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-quinolyl] prop-2-enenitrile had the following characteristics:

and two portions of toluene (9 mL). The organic portion was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The dried organic 
portion was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to give 307 mg (yield 91%) of 3-[2-
cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-quinolyl] prop-2-enal as yellow solid (purity 97%, in terms of an area percent according 
to high performance liquid chromatography).

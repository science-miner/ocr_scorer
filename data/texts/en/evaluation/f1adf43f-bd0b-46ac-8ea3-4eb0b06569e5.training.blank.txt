By employing the monotone iterative method, this paper not only establishes the existence of the minimal and maximal positive 
solutions for multipoint fractional boundary value problem on an unbounded domain, but also develops two computable explicit 
monotone iterative sequences for approximating the two positive solutions. An example is given for the illustration of the main 
result. 

1. Introduction 

The fractional calculus has been recognized as an effective 
modeling methodology for describing hereditary properties 
of various materials and processes widely. For a lot of appli-
cations, we refer the reader to the books [1-5]. For some 
new development on the topic, see [6-17] and the references 
therein. 
Recently, there has been a significant development on 
boundary value problems for fractional differential equations 
on infinite intervals; see papers [18-26], in which authors 
are devoted to investigating the existence of solutions and 
positive solutions by employing some fixed point theorems, 
Leray-Schauder nonlinear alternative theorem, or fixed point 
index theory. 
By using Schauder's fixed point theorem combined with 
the diagonalization method, Arara et al. [18] studied the 
existence of the bounded solution of the following problem 
on infinite intervals: 

𝐶 𝐷 𝛼 
0+ 𝑦 (𝑡) = 𝑓 (𝑡, 𝑦 (𝑡)) , 1 &lt; 𝛼 ≤ 2, 

𝑦 (0) = 𝑦 0 , 𝑦 is bounded on 𝐽, 

(1) 

where 𝑡 ∈ 𝐽 = [0, +∞), 𝑓 ∈ 𝐶(𝐽 × R, R), 𝑦 0 ∈ R, and 𝐶 𝐷 𝛼 

0+ 

is the Caputo fractional derivative of order 𝛼. 

In [19], Zhao and Ge investigated the existence of pos-
itive solutions for the following fractional boundary value 
problem by employing the Leray-Schauder nonlinear alter-
native theorem: 

𝐷 𝛼 
0+ 𝑢 (𝑡) + 𝑓 (𝑡, 𝑢 (𝑡)) = 0, 1 &lt; 𝛼 ≤ 2, 

𝑢 (0) = 0, 
lim 

𝑡 → +∞ 

𝐷 𝛼−1 
0+ = 𝛽𝑢 (𝜉) , 

(2) 

where 𝑡 ∈ 𝐽 = [0, +∞), 𝑓 ∈ 𝐶(𝐽 × R, [0, +∞)), 0 ≤ 𝜉, 
𝜂 &lt; ∞, and 𝐷 𝛼 
0+ is the standard Riemann-Liouville fractional 
derivative. 
Liang and Zhang [20] were concerned with the following 
nonlinear fractional differential equations with multipoint 
fractional boundary conditions on an unbounded domain: 

𝐷 𝛼 𝑢 (𝑡) + 𝑎 (𝑡) 𝑓 (𝑡, 𝑢 (𝑡)) = 0, 0 &lt; 𝑡 &lt; ∞, 

𝑢 (0) = 𝑢 󸀠 (0) = 0,

mann-Liouville fractional derivative, 0 &lt; 𝜉 1 &lt; 𝜉 2 &lt; ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ &lt;

&lt; Γ(𝛼). By using the fixed point index 
theory, authors gave sufficient conditions for the existence of 
multiple positive solutions to the above multi-point fractional 
boundary value problem. 
However, very interesting and important question is "If 
we know the existence of the solution, how can we find it?" 
This question motivates us to reconsider problem (3). In this 
paper, we not only establish the existence of two positive 
solutions for problem (3), but also develop two computable 
explicit monotone iterative sequences for approximating the 
minimal and maximal positive solutions of (3), which is 
indeed an important and useful contribution to the existing 
literature on the topic. In addition, to start our work, we 
employ the monotone iterative method, which is different 
from the ones used in [18-26]. Let us state that this method 
was widely used for nonlinear problem; see, for instance, [27-
38]. 

2. Preliminaries and Several Lemmas 

In this section, we present some useful definitions and related 
theorems. 

Definition 1 (see [2]). The Riemann-Liouville fractional deri-
vative of order 𝛿 for a continuous function 𝑓 is defined by 

𝐷 𝛿 𝑓 (𝑡) = 
1 
Γ (𝑛 − 𝛿) 
( 
𝑑 
𝑑𝑡 
) 

𝑛 

× ∫ 

𝑡 

0 

(𝑡 − 𝑠) 𝑛−𝛿−1 𝑓 (𝑠) 𝑑𝑠, 𝑛 = [𝛿] + 1, 

(4) 

provided the right-hand side is pointwise defined on (0, ∞) 
and [𝛿] is the integer part of 𝛿. 

Definition 2 (see [2]). The Riemann-Liouville fractional inte-
gral of order 𝛿 for a function 𝑓 is defined as 

𝐼 𝛿 𝑓 (𝑡) = 
1 
Γ (𝛿) 
∫ 

𝑡 

0 

(𝑡 − 𝑠) 𝛿−1 𝑓 (𝑠) 𝑑𝑠, 𝛿 &gt; 0, 
(5) 

provided that such integral exists. 

Lemma 3 (see [20]). Let ℎ ∈ 𝐶([0, +∞)). For 2 &lt; 𝛼 &lt; 3, the 
fractional boundary value problem 

𝐷 𝛼 𝑢 (𝑡) + ℎ (𝑡) = 0, 

𝑢 (0) = 𝑢 󸀠 (0) = 0, 

𝐷 𝛼−1 𝑢 (+∞) = 

𝑚−2 

∑ 

𝑖=1 

𝛽 𝑖 𝑢 (𝜉 𝑖 ) 

(6) 

has a unique solution 

𝑢 (𝑡) = ∫ 

+∞ 

0 

𝐺 (𝑡, 𝑠) ℎ (𝑠) 𝑑𝑠, 
(7) 

where 

𝐺 (𝑡, 𝑠) = 𝐺  *  (𝑡, 𝑠) + 𝐺  *  *  (𝑡, 𝑠) , 
(8) 

with 

𝐺  *  (𝑡, 𝑠) = 
1 
Γ (𝛼) 
{ 
𝑡 𝛼−1 − (𝑡 − 𝑠) 𝛼−1 , 0 ≤ 𝑠 ≤ 𝑡 &lt; +∞, 
𝑡 𝛼−1 , 
0 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 𝑠 &lt; +∞, 

𝐺  *  *  (𝑡, 𝑠) = 
∑ 𝑚−2 
𝑖=1 𝛽 𝑖 𝑡 𝛼−1 
Γ (𝛼) − ∑ 𝑚−2 
𝑖=1 𝛽 𝑖 𝜉 𝛼−1 

𝑖 

𝐺  *  (𝜉 𝑖 , 𝑠) . 

(9) 

Lemma 4 (see [20]). For (𝑠, 𝑡) ∈ [0, +∞) × [0, +∞), then 
Green's function 𝐺(𝑡, 𝑠) has the following properties: 

(1) 

0 ≤ 𝐺 (𝑡, 𝑠) ≤ 𝐿𝑡 𝛼−1 , 
(10) 

(2) 

𝐺 (𝑡, 𝑠) 
1 + 𝑡 𝛼−1 ≤ 𝐿, 
(11) 

where 

𝐿 = 
1

Γ (𝛼) (Γ (𝛼) − ∑ 𝑚−2 
𝑖=1 𝛽 𝑖 𝜉 𝛼−1

) 
. 
(12) 

For the forthcoming analysis, we will use a Banach space: 

𝑋 = {𝑢 ∈ 𝐶 (𝐽, R) : sup 

𝑡∈𝐽 

|𝑢 (𝑡)| 
1 + 𝑡 𝛼−1 &lt; +∞} , 
(13) 

equipped with the norm 

‖𝑢‖ 𝑋 = sup 

𝑡∈𝐽 

|𝑢 (𝑡)| 
1 + 𝑡 𝛼−1 . 
(14) 

Define a cone 𝑃 ⊂ 𝑋 by 

𝑃 = {𝑢 ∈ 𝑋 : 𝑢 (𝑡) ≥ 0, 𝑡 ∈ 𝐽} 
(15) 

and an operator 𝑄 : 𝑋 → 𝑋 as follows: 

𝑄𝑢 (𝑡) = ∫ 

∞ 

0 

𝐺 (𝑡, 𝑠) 𝑎 (𝑠) 𝑓 (𝑠, 𝑢 (𝑠)) 𝑑𝑠. 
(16) 

Observe that multi-point fractional boundary value prob-
lem (3) has a solution if and only if the integral operator 𝑄 has 
a fixed point. 

3. Main Results 

In this section, we shall construct two explicit monotone 
iterative sequences which converge to the minimal and 
maximal positive solutions of (3). 

Theorem 5. Assume that the following conditions hold: 

(H 1 ) 𝑓 ∈ 𝐶(𝐽 × 𝐽, 𝐽), 𝑓(𝑡, 0) ̸ 
≡ 0 on any subinterval of 𝐽, 
and when 𝑢 is bounded, 𝑓(𝑡, (1 + 𝑡 𝛼−1 )𝑢) is bounded on 
𝐽; 

(H 2 ) 𝑎 : 𝐽 → 𝐽 does not identically vanish on any subinte-
rval of 𝐽 and 0 &lt; ∫ 

+∞ 

0 

𝑎(𝑡)𝑑𝑡 &lt; ∞; 


Journal of Function Spaces

(H 3 ) 𝑓(𝑡, ⋅) is nondecreasing for any 𝑡 ∈ 𝐽, and there 
exists a constant 𝑏 &gt; 0, such that 𝑓(𝑡, (1 + 𝑡 𝛼−1 )𝑢) ≤ 
𝑏/𝐿 ∫ 

∞ 

0 𝑎(𝑡)𝑑𝑡 for (𝑡, 𝑢) ∈ 𝐽 × [0, 𝑏]. 
Then the multi-point fractional boundary value problem 
(3) has the minimal and maximal positive solutions V  *  , 𝑢  *  in 
(0, 𝑏𝑡 𝛼−1 ], which can be obtained by the following two explicit 
monotone iterative sequences: 

V 𝑛+1 = ∫ 

+∞

𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ 𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 V𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑢 0 (𝑡) = 𝑏𝑡 𝛼−1 . 

(17) 

Moreover, 

V 0 ≤ V 1 ≤ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ≤ V 𝑛 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ≤ V  *  ≤ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ 

≤ 𝑢  *  ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ≤ 𝑢 𝑛 ≤ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ≤ 𝑢 1 ≤ 𝑢 0 . 
(18) 

Proof. By a similar process used in [20], it is easy to show that 
𝑄 : 𝑃 → 𝑃 is completely continuous. 
Now denote 𝐵 = {𝑢 ∈ 𝑃, ‖𝑢‖ 𝑋 ≤ 𝑏}; then we have 𝑄(𝐵) ⊂ 
𝐵. In fact, let 𝑢 ∈ 𝐵; then by (H 3 ) and (12), we have 

‖𝑄𝑢‖ 𝑋 = sup 

𝑡∈𝐽

𝑎 (𝑠) 𝑑𝑠 
= 𝑏. 

(19) 

That is, 𝑄(𝐵) ⊂ 𝐵. 
Denote that V 0 (𝑡) = 0, V 1 = 𝑄0 = 𝑄V 0 , and V 2 = 𝑄 2 0 = 
𝑄V 1 , for all 𝑡 ∈ 𝐽. Since V 0 (𝑡) = 0 ∈ 𝐵 and 𝑄 : 𝐵 → 𝐵, then 
V 1 ∈ 𝑄(𝐵) ⊂ 𝐵 and V 2 ∈ 𝑄(𝐵) ⊂ 𝐵. So, we have 

V 1 (𝑡) = (𝑄0) (𝑡) ≥ 0 = V 0 (𝑡) , ∀𝑡 ∈ 𝐽. 
(20) 

By condition (H 3 ), for 𝑢, V ∈ 𝐵 and 𝑢 ≥ V, we have 

𝑄𝑢 (𝑡) = ∫ 

∞ 

0 

𝐺 (𝑡, 𝑠) 𝑎 (𝑠) 𝑓 (𝑠, 𝑢 (𝑠)) 𝑑𝑠 

≥ ∫ 

∞ 

0 

𝐺 (𝑡, 𝑠) 𝑎 (𝑠) 𝑓 (𝑠, V (𝑠)) 𝑑𝑠 = 𝑄V (𝑡) . 

(21) 

This proves that 𝑄 is a nondecreasing operator. 
So, we have 

V 2 (𝑡) = (𝑄V 1 ) (𝑡) ≥ (𝑄V 0 ) (𝑡) = V 1 (𝑡) , ∀𝑡 ∈ 𝐽. 
(22) 

By the induction, define V 𝑛+1 = 𝑄V 𝑛 , 𝑛 = 0, 1, 2, . . .. Then 
the sequence {V 𝑛 } ∞ 
𝑛=1 ⊂ 𝑄(𝐵) ⊂ 𝐵 and satisfies the following 
relation: 

V 𝑛+1 (𝑡) ≥ V 𝑛 (𝑡) , ∀𝑡 ∈ 𝐽, 𝑛 = 0, 1, 2, . . . . 
(23) 

In view of the complete continuity of the operator 𝑄 and 
V 𝑛+1 = 𝑄V 𝑛 , then {V 𝑛 } ∞ 
𝑛=1 is relative compact. That is, {V 𝑛 } ∞ 

𝑛=1 

has a convergent subsequence {V 𝑛 𝑘 } ∞ 
𝑘=1 and there exists a V  *  ∈ 
𝐵 such that V 𝑛 𝑘 → V  *  as 𝑘 → ∞. This, together with (23), 
holds lim 𝑛 → ∞ V 𝑛 = V  *  . 
Since 𝑄 is continuous and V 𝑛+1 = 𝑄V 𝑛 , then we have 
𝑄V  *  = V  *  . That is, V  *  is a fixed point of the operator 𝑄. 
Denote that 𝑢 0 (𝑡) = 𝑏𝑡 𝛼−1 , 𝑢 1 = 𝑄𝑢 0 , and 𝑢 2 = 𝑄 2 𝑢 0 = 
𝑄𝑢 1 , for all 𝑡 ∈ 𝐽. Since 𝑢 0 (𝑡) ∈ 𝐵 and 𝑄 : 𝐵 → 𝐵, then 
𝑢 1 ∈ 𝑄(𝐵) ⊂ 𝐵 and 𝑢 2 ∈ 𝑄(𝐵) ⊂ 𝐵. By (H 3 ), we have 

𝑢 1 (𝑡) = ∫ 

+∞ 

0 

𝐺 (𝑡, 𝑠) 𝑎 (𝑠) 𝑓 (𝑠, 𝑢 0 (𝑠)) 𝑑𝑠 

≤ ∫ 

+∞

𝐿𝑡 𝛼−1 𝑎 (𝑠) 𝑑𝑠 ⋅ 
𝑏 

∫ 

+∞ 

0 

𝐿𝑎 (𝑠) 𝑑𝑠 

= 𝑏𝑡 𝛼−1 = 𝑢 0 (𝑡) , ∀𝑡 ∈ 𝐽. 

(24) 

Since 𝑄 is nondecreasing, then we have 

𝑢 2 (𝑡) = (𝑄𝑢 1 ) (𝑡) ≤ (𝑄𝑢 0 ) (𝑡) = 𝑢 1 (𝑡) , ∀𝑡 ∈ 𝐽. 
(25) 

By the induction, define 𝑢 𝑛+1 = 𝑄𝑢 𝑛 , 𝑛 = 0, 1, 2, . . .. Then 
the sequence {𝑢 𝑛 } ∞ 
𝑛=1 ⊂ 𝑄(𝐵) ⊂ 𝐵 and satisfies the following 
relation: 

𝑢 𝑛+1 (𝑡) ≤ 𝑢 𝑛 (𝑡) , ∀𝑡 ∈ 𝐽, 𝑛 = 0, 1, 2, . . . . 
(26) 

With an analysis exactly parallel to the proving process of 
lim 𝑛 → ∞ V 𝑛 = V  *  , we have that there exists a 𝑢  *  ∈ 𝐵 such that 
lim 𝑛 → ∞ 𝑢 𝑛 = 𝑢  *  . 
Since 𝑄 is continuous and 𝑢 𝑛+1 = 𝑄𝑢 𝑛 , we have 𝑄𝑢  *  = 𝑢  *  . 
That is, 𝑢  *  is a fixed point of the operator 𝑄. 
Now, we are in a position to show that 𝑢  *  and V  *  are the 
maximal and minimal positive solutions of (3) in (0, 𝑏𝑡 𝛼−1 ]. 
Let 𝑤 ∈ [0, 𝑏𝑡 𝛼−1 ] be any solution of (3). That is 𝑄𝑤 = 
𝑤. Noting that 𝑄 is nondecreasing and V 0 (𝑡) = 0 ≤ 𝑤(𝑡) ≤ 
𝑏𝑡 𝛼−1 = 𝑢 0 (𝑡), then we have V 1 (𝑡) = 𝑄V 0 (𝑡) ≤ 𝑤(𝑡) ≤ 𝑄𝑢 0 (𝑡) = 
𝑢 1 (𝑡), for all 𝑡 ∈ 𝐽. 
Similarly, we can obtain 

V 𝑛 (𝑡) ≤ 𝑤 (𝑡) ≤ 𝑢 𝑛 (𝑡) , ∀𝑡 ∈ 𝐽, 𝑛 = 0, 1, 2, . . . . 
(27) 

Since 𝑢  *  = lim 𝑛 → ∞ 𝑢 𝑛 and V  *  = lim 𝑛 → ∞ V 𝑛 , it follows 
from (23)∼(27) that 

V 0 ≤ V 1 ≤ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ≤ V 𝑛 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ≤ V  *  

≤ 𝑤 ≤ 𝑢  *  ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ≤ 𝑢 𝑛 ≤ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ≤ 𝑢 1 ≤ 𝑢 0 . 
(28) 

Since 𝑓(𝑡, 0) 
̸ 
≡ 0, for all 𝑡 ∈ 𝐽, then 0 is not a 
solution of problem (3). Thus, by (28), we know that 𝑢  *  and 
V  *  are the maximal and minimal positive solutions of (3) 
in (0, 𝑏𝑡 𝛼−1 ], which can be obtained by the corresponding 
iterative sequences in (17). 
This completes the proof.

𝜉 2 = 1. Consider the following boundary value problem: 

𝐷 5/2 𝑢 (𝑡) + 𝑒 −𝑡 𝑓 (𝑡, 𝑢 (𝑡)) = 0, 𝑡 ∈ (0, +∞)

(30) 

Now, we show that 𝑓(𝑡, (1 + 𝑡 𝛼−1 )𝑢) is bounded on 𝐽 when 
𝑢 is bounded. Since 

𝑓 (𝑡, (1 + 𝑡 3/2 ) 𝑢) 

=

(31) 

Then we have 𝑓(𝑡, (1 + 𝑡 3/2 )𝑢) ≤ 11/100. So condition (H 1 ) 
holds. 
In view of ∫

𝑎(𝑡)𝑑𝑡 = ∫

𝑒 −𝑡 𝑑𝑡 = 1, condition (H 2 ) 
holds. 
By a simple computation, we have that Γ(𝛼) = Γ(5/2) = 
3√𝜋/4 and 𝐿 = (1/Γ(𝛼)) + (∑ 𝑚−2 
𝑖=1 𝛽 𝑖 𝜉 𝛼−1 
𝑚−2 /Γ(𝛼)(Γ(𝛼) −

)) ≈ 1.096741. Taking 𝑏 = 1, it follows that

(32) 

Hence, condition (H 3 ) holds. Thus all conditions of 
Theorem 5 are satisfied. Therefore, the fractional boundary 
value problem (29) has the minimal and maximal positive 
solutions in (0, 𝑡 3/2 ], which can be obtained by two explicit 
monotone iterative sequences.

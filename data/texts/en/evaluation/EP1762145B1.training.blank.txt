Description 

Background of the Invention 

[0001] The invention relates to texturized cellulosic or lignocellulosic materials (e.g., texturized poly-coated paper) 
and compositions and composites made from such texturized materials. 
[0002] Cellulosic and lignocellulosic materials are produced, processed, and used in large quantities in a number of 
applications. For example, paper coated with a polymer (i.e., poly-coated paper) is used to make a variety of food 
containers, including individual-serving size juice cartons and boxes for frozen foods. Once used, these cellulosic and 
lignocellulosic materials are usually discarded. As a result, there is an ever-increasing amount of waste cellulosic and 
lignocellulosic material. 
[0003] US application US 4791020 discloses composites made from cellulose fibers dispersed in a matrix of polyeth-
ylene and an isocyanate and bonded thereto during subsequent extrusion and or molding. 

Summary of the Invention 

[0004] The invention provides a composition according to claim 1 and a method of forming a composition according 
to claim 9. 
[0005] Also disclosed herein is a process for preparing a texturized fibrous material. The process involves shearing 
a cellulosic or lignocellulosic material having internal fibers (e.g., flax, hemp, cotton, jute, rags, finished or unfinished 
paper, poly-coated paper, paper products, or byproducts of paper manufacturing such as pulp board, or synthetic cellulosic 
or lignocellulosic materials such as rayon), to the extent that the internal fibers are substantially exposed, resulting in 
texturized fibrous material. The cellulosic or lignocellulosic material can be, for example, a woven material such as a 
woven fabric, or a non-woven material such as paper or bathroom tissue. The exposed fibers of the texturized fibrous 
material can have a length/ diameter (L/D) ratio of at least about 5 (e.g., at least about 5, 10, 25, 50, or more). For 
example, at least about 50% of the fibers can have L/D ratios of this magnitude. 
[0006] The invention features a texturized fibrous material that includes a cellulosic or lignocellulosic material (e.g., 
poly-coated paper) having internal fibers, where the cellulosic or lignocellulosic material is sheared to the extent that the 
internal fibers are substantially exposed. 
[0007] The texturized fibrous material can, for example, be incorporated into (e.g., associated with, blended with, 
adjacent to, surrounded by, or within) a structure or carrier (e.g., a netting, a membrane, a flotation device, a bag, a 
shell, or a biodegradable substance). Optionally, the structure or carrier may itself be made from a texturized fibrous 
material (e.g., a texturized fibrous material of the invention), or of a composition or composite of a texturized fibrous 
material. 
[0008] The texturized fibrous material can have a bulk density less than about 0.5 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm 3 ), 
or even less than about 0.2 g/cm 3 . 
[0009] Compositions that include the texturized fibrous materials described above, together with a chemical or chemical 
formulation (e.g., a pharmaceutical such as an antibiotic or contraceptive, optionally with an excipient; an agricultural 
compound such as a fertilizer, herbicide, or pesticide; or a formulation that includes enzymes) are also within the scope 
of the invention, as are compositions that include the texturized fibrous materials and other liquid or solid ingredients 
(e.g., particulate, powdered, or granulated solids such as plant seed, foodstuffs, or bacteria). 
[0010] Composites that include thermoplastic resin and the texturized fibrous materials are also contemplated. The 
resin can be, for example, polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polycarbonate, polybutylene, a thermoplastic pol-
yester, a polyether, a thermoplastic polyurethane, polyvinylchloride, or a polyamide, or a combination of two or more 
resins. 
[0011] In some cases, at least about 5% by weight (e.g., 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%, 99%, or about 100%) 
of the fibrous material included in the composites is texturized. 
[0012] The composite may include, for example, about 30% to about 70% by weight resin and about 30% to about 
70% by weight texturized fibrous material, although proportions outside of these ranges may also be used. The composites 
can be quite strong, in some cases having a flexural strength of at least about 6,000 to 10,000 psi. 
[0013] The composites can also include inorganic additives such as calcium carbonate, graphite, asbestos, wollas-
tonite, mica, glass, fiber glass, chalk, talc, silica, ceramic, ground construction waste, tire rubber powder, carbon fibers, 
or metal fibers (e.g., stainless steel or aluminum). 
[0014] The inorganic additives can represent about 0.5% to about 20% of the total weight of the composite. 
[0015] The composite can be in the form of, for example, a pallet (e.g., an injection molded pallet), pipes, panels, 
decking materials, boards, housings, sheets, poles, straps, fencing, members, doors, shutters, awnings, shades, signs, 
frames, window casings, backboards, wallboards, flooring, tiles, railroad ties, forms, trays, tool handles, stalls, bedding, 
dispensers, staves, films, wraps, totes, barrels, boxes, packing materials, baskets, straps, slips, racks, casings, binders,

dividers, walls, indoor and outdoor carpets, rugs, wovens, and mats, frames, bookcases, sculptures, chairs, tables, 
desks, art, toys, games, wharves, piers, boats, masts, pollution control products, septic tanks, automotive panels, sub-
strates, computer housings, above-and below-ground electrical casings, furniture, picnic tables, tents, playgrounds, 
benches, shelters, sporting goods, beds, bedpans, thread, filament, cloth, plaques, trays, hangers, servers, pools, in-
sulation, caskets, bookcovers, clothes, canes, crutches, and other construction, agricultural, material handling, trans-
portation, automotive, industrial, environmental, naval, electrical, electronic, recreational, medical, textile, and consumer 
products. The composites can also be in the form of a fiber, filament, or film. 
[0016] The terms "texturized cellulosic or lignocellulosic material" and "texturized fibrous material" as used herein, 
mean that the cellulosic or lignocellulosic material has been sheared to the extent that its internal fibers are substantially 
exposed. At least about 50%, more preferably at least about 70%, of these fibers have a length/ diameter (L/D) ratio of 
at least 5, more preferably at least 25, or at least 50. An example of texturized cellulosic material (i.e., texturized newsprint) 
is shown in Fig. 1. An example of texturized poly-coated paper is shown in Fig. 2. 
[0017] The texturized fibrous materials of the invention have properties that render them useful for various applications. 
For example, the texturized fibrous materials have absorbent properties, which can be exploited, for example, for pollution 
control. The fibers are generally biodegradable, making them suitable, for example, for drug or chemical delivery (e.g., 
in the treatment of humans, animals, or in agricultural applications). The texturized fibrous materials can also be used 
to reinforce polymeric resins. 
[0018] Those composites that include texturized fibrous material and resin are strong, light-weight, and inexpensive. 
The raw materials used to make the composites are available as virgin or recycled materials; for example, they may 
include discarded containers composed of resins, and waste cellulosic or lignocellulosic fiber (e.g., discarded containers 
composed of poly-coated paper). 
[0019] Poly-coated paper can be difficult to recycle because the paper and the polymer layers generally cannot be 
separated. In the present invention, both the paper and the polymer portions are utilized, so there is no need to separate 
the two. Poly-coated paper including one or more layers of aluminum can similarly be used. The invention thus helps to 
recycle discarded post-consumer containers, while at the same time producing useful products. 
[0020] Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description, and 
from the claims.

Detailed Description of the Invention 

[0022] Examples of cellulosic raw materials include paper and paper products such as newsprint and effluent from 
paper manufacture, and poly-coated paper. Examples of lignocellulosic raw materials include wood, wood fibers, and 
wood-related materials, as well as materials derived from kenaf, grasses, rice hulls, bagasse, cotton, jute, other stem 
plants (e.g., hemp, flax, bamboo; both bast and core fibers), leaf plants (e.g., sisal, abaca), and agricultural fibers (e.g., 
cereal straw, corn cobs, rice hulls, and coconut hair). Aside from virgin raw materials, post-consumer, industrial (e.g., 
offal), and processing waste (e.g., effluent) can also be used as fiber sources. 
[0023] Poly-coated paper is available in a variety of forms. For example, whole sheets of virgin poly-coated paper can 
be purchased from International Paper, New York. Alternatively, virgin waste poly-coated paper (e.g., edge trimmings, 
surplus, misprinted stock) can be obtained from International Paper or other paper manufacturers. Used poly-coated 
paper, in the form of discarded food and beverage containers, can be gathered from various sources, including waste 
and recycling streams. Poly-coated paper can be made of a polymer (e.g., polyethylene) and paper, and, in some cases, 
one or more layers of aluminum. Poly-coated paper that includes one or more layers of aluminum foil is commonly used 
for airtight liquid storage. Used, waste, or scrap poly-coated paper (e.g., post-consumer waste, industrial offal) can also 
be purchased from brokers of this material.

Preparation of Texturized Fibrous Material 

[0024] If scrap cellulosic or lignocellulosic materials are used, they should be clean and dry. The raw material can be 
texturized using any one of a number of mechanical means, or combinations thereof. One method of texturizing includes 
first cutting the cellulosic or lignocellulosic material into 1/4-to 1/2-inch pieces, if necessary, using a standard cutting 
apparatus. Counter-rotating screw shredders and segmented rotating screw shredders such as those manufactured by 
Munson (Utica, NY) can also be used, as can a standard document shredder as found in many offices. 
[0025] The cellulosic or lignocellulosic material is then sheared with a rotary cutter, such as the one manufactured by 
Sprout, Waldron Companies, as described in Perry's Chem. Eng. Handbook, 6th Ed., at 8-29 (1984). Although other 
settings can be used, the spacing between the rotating knives and bed knives of the rotary cutter is typically set to 
0.020" or less, and blade rotation is set to 750 rpm or more. The rotary cutter can be cooled to 100°C or lower during 
the process, for example, using a water jacket. 
[0026] The texturized material is passed through a discharge screen. Larger screens (e.g., up to 6 mm) can be used 
in large-scale production. The cellulosic or lignocellulosic feedstock is generally kept in contact with the blades of the 
rotary cutter until the fibers are pulled apart; smaller screens (e.g., 2 mm mesh) provide longer residence times and 
more complete texturization, but can result in lower length/ diameter (L/D) aspect ratios. A vacuum drawer can be attached 
to the screen to maximize and maintain fiber length/ diameter aspect ratio. 
[0027] The texturized fibrous materials can be directly stored in sealed bags or may be dried at approximately 105°C 
for 4-18 hours (e.g., until the moisture content is less than about 0.5%) immediately before use. Fig. 1 is an SEM 
photograph of texturized newspaper. 

Uses of Texturized Fibrous Material 

[0028] Texturized fibrous materials and compositions and composites of such fibers with other chemicals and chemical 
formulations can be prepared to take advantage of the material's properties. The materials can be used to absorb 
chemicals, for example, potentially absorbing many times their own weight. Thus, the materials could, for instance, be 
used to absorb spilled oil, or for clean-up of environmental pollution, for example, in water, in the air, or on land. Similarly, 
the material's absorbent properties, together with its biodegradability, also make them useful for delivery of chemicals 
or chemical formulations. For example, the materials can be treated with solutions of enzymes or pharmaceuticals such 
as antibiotics, nutrients, or contraceptives, and any necessary excipients, for drug delivery (e.g., for treatment of humans 
or animals, or for use as or in animal feed and/or bedding), as well as with solutions of fertilizers, herbicides, or pesticides. 
The materials can optionally be chemically treated to enhance a specific absorption property. For example, the materials 
can be treated with silanes to render them lipophilic. 
[0029] Compositions including texturized materials combined with liquids or particulate, powdered, or granulated solids 
can also be prepared. For example, texturized fibrous materials can be blended with seeds (i.e., with or without treatment 
with a solution of fertilizer, pesticides, etc.), foodstuffs, or bacteria (e.g., bacteria that digest toxins). The ratio of fibrous 
materials to the other components of the compositions will depend on the nature of the components and readily be 
adjusted for a specific product application. 
[0030] In some cases, it may be advantageous to associate the texturized fibrous materials, or compositions or com-
posites of such materials, with a structure or carrier such as a netting, a membrane, a flotation device, a bag, a shell, 
or a biodegradable substance. Optionally, the structure of carrier may itself be made of a texturized fibrous material 
(e.g., a material of the invention), or a composition or composite thereof. 

Composites of Texturized Fibrous Material and Resin 

[0031] Texturized fibrous materials can also be combined with resins to form strong, lightweight composites. Materials 
that have been treated with chemicals or chemical formulations, as described above, can similarly be combined with 
biodegradable or non-biodegradable resins to form composites, allowing the introduction of, for example, hydrophilic 
substances into otherwise hydrophobic polymer matrices. Alternatively, the composites including texturized fibrous 
materials and resin can be treated with chemicals or chemical formulations. 
[0032] The texturized cellulosic or lignocellulosic material provides the composite with strength. The composite may 
include from about 10% to about 90%, for example from about 30% to about 70%, of the texturized cellulosic or ligno-
cellulosic material by weight. Combinations of texturized fibrous materials can also be used (e.g., texturized poly-coated 
paper blended with texturized wood-related materials or other cellulosic or lignocellulosic fibers). 
[0033] The resin encapsulates the texturized cellulosic or lignocellulosic material in the composites, and helps control 
the shape of the composites. The resin also transfers external loads to the fibrous materials and protects the fiber from 
environmental and structural damage. Composites can include, for example, about 10% to about 90%, more preferably 
about 30% to about 70%, by weight, of the resin.

[0034] Examples of resins that are suitably combined with texturized fibers include polyethylene (including, e.g., low 
density polyethylene and high density polyethylene), polypropylene, polystyrene, polycarbonate, polybutylene, thermo-
plastic polyesters (e.g., PET), polyethers, thermoplastic polyurethane, PVC, polyamides (e.g., nylon) and other resins. 
It is preferred that the resins have a low melt flow index. Preferred resins include polyethylene and polypropylene with 
melt flow indices of less than 3 g/ 10 min, and more preferably less than 1 g/ 10 min. 
[0035] The resins can be purchased as virgin material, or obtained as waste materials, and can be purchased in 
pelletized or granulated form. One source of waste resin is used polyethylene milk bottles. If surface moisture is present 
on the pelletized or granulated resin, however, it should be dried before use. 
[0036] The composites can also include coupling agents. The coupling agents help to bond the hydrophilic fibers to 
the hydrophobic resins. Examples of coupling agents include maleic anhydride modified polyethylenes, such those in 
the FUSABOND® (available from Dupont, Delaware) and POLYBOND® (available from Uniroyal Chemical, Connecticut) 
series. One suitable coupling agent is a maleic anhydride modified high density polyethylene such as FUSABOND® MB 
100D. 
[0037] The composites can also contain additives known to those in the art of compounding, such as plasticizers, 
lubricants, antioxidants, opacificers, heat stabilizers, colorants, flame retardants, biocides, impact modifiers, photosta-
bilizers, and antistatic agents. 
[0038] The composites can also include inorganic additives such as calcium carbonate, graphite, asbestos, wollas-
tonite, mica, glass, fiber glass, chalk, silica, talc, ceramic, ground construction waste, tire rubber powder, carbon fibers, 
or metal fibers (e.g., aluminum, stainless steel). When such additives are included, they are typically present in quantities 
of from about 0.5% up to about 20-30% by weight. For example, submicron calcium carbonate can be added to the 
composites of texturized fibrous material and resin to improve impact modification characteristics or to enhance composite 
strength. 

Preparation of Compositions 

[0039] Compositions containing the texturized cellulosic or lignocellulosic materials and chemicals, chemical formu-
lations, or other solids can be prepared, for example, in various immersion, spraying, or blending apparatuses, including, 
but not limited to, ribbon blenders, cone blenders, double cone blenders, and Patterson-Kelly "V" blenders. 
[0040] For example, a composition containing 90% by weight texturized cellulosic or lignocellulosic material and 10% 
by weight ammonium phosphate or sodium bicarbonate can be prepared in a cone blender to create a fire-retardant 
material for absorbing oil. 

Preparation of Composites of Texturized Fiber and Resin 

[0041] Composites of texturized fibrous material and resin can be prepared as follows. A standard rubber/ plastic 
compounding 2-roll mill is heated to 325-400°F. The resin (usually in the form of pellets or granules) is added to the 
heated roll mill. After about 5 to 10 minutes, the coupling agent is added to the roll mill. After another five minutes, the 
texturized cellulosic or lignocellulosic material is added to the molten resin/ coupling agent mixture. The texturized material 
is added over a period of about 10 minutes. 
[0042] The composite is removed from the roll mill, cut into sheets and allowed to cool to room temperature. It is then 
compression molded into plaques using standard compression molding techniques. 
[0043] Alternatively, a mixer, such as a Banbury internal mixer, is charged with the ingredients. The ingredients are 
mixed, while the temperature is maintained at less than about 190°C. The mixture can then be compression molded. 
[0044] In another embodiment, the ingredients can be mixed in an extruder mixer, such as a twin-screw extruder 
equipped with co-rotating screws. The resin and the coupling agent are introduced at the extruder feed throat; the 
texturized cellulosic or lignocellulosic material or materials are introduced about 1/3 of the way down the length of the 
extruder into the molten resin. The internal temperature of the extruder is maintained at less than about 190°C. At the 
output, the composite can be, for example, pelletized by cold strand cutting. 
[0045] Alternatively, the mixture can first be prepared in a mixer, then transferred to an extruder. 
[0046] In another embodiment, the composite can be formed into filaments for knitting, warping, weaving, braiding, 
or in the manufacture of non-wovens. In a further embodiment, the composite can be made into a film. 

Properties of the Composites of Texturized Fibrous Material and Resin 

[0047] The resulting composites include a network of fibers, encapsulated within a resin matrix. The fibers form a 
lattice network, which provides the composite with strength. Since the cellulosic or lignocellulosic material is texturized, 
the amount of surface area available to bond to the resin is increased, in comparison to composites prepared with un-
texturized cellulosic or lignocellulosic material. The resin binds to the surfaces of the exposed fibers, creating an intimate 


EP 1 762 145 B1

blend of the fiber network and the resin matrix. The intimate blending of the fibers and the resin matrix further strengthens 
the composites. 

Uses of the Composites of Texturized Fibrous Material and Resin 

[0048] The resin/ fibrous material composites can be used in a number of applications. The composites are strong and 
light weight; they can be used, for example, as wood substitutes. The resin coating renders the composites water-
resistant, so they may be used in outdoor applications. For example, the composites may be used to make pallets, which 
are often stored outdoors for extended periods of time, wine staves, rowboats, furniture, skis, and oars. Many other uses 
are contemplated, including panels, pipes, decking materials, boards, housings, sheets, poles, straps, fencing, members, 
doors, shutters, awnings, shades, signs, frames, window casings, backboards, wallboards, flooring, tiles, railroad ties, 
forms, trays, tool handles, stalls, bedding, dispensers, staves, films, wraps, totes, barrels, boxes, packing materials, 
baskets, straps, slips, racks, casings, binders, dividers, walls, indoor and outdoor carpets, rugs, wovens, and mats, 
frames, bookcases, sculptures, chairs, tables, desks, art, toys, games, wharves, piers, boats, masts, pollution control 
products, septic tanks, automotive panels, substrates, computer housings, above-and below-ground electrical casings, 
furniture, picnic tables, tents, playgrounds, benches, shelters, sporting goods, beds, bedpans, thread, filament, cloth, 
plaques, trays, hangers, servers, pools, insulation, caskets, bookcovers, clothes, canes, crutches, and other construction, 
agricultural, material handling, transportation, automotive, industrial, environmental, naval, electrical, electronic, recre-
ational, medical, textile, and consumer products. Numerous other applications are also envisioned. The composites may 
also be used, for example, as the base or carcass for a veneer product. Moreover, the composites can be, for example, 
surface treated, grooved, milled, shaped, imprinted, textured, compressed, punched, or colored. The surface of the 
composites can be smooth or rough. 
[0049] The following examples illustrate certain embodiments and aspects of the present invention and not to be 
construed as limiting the scope thereof. 

Examples 

Example 1 

[0050] A 1500 pound skid of virgin, half-gallon juice cartons made of polycoated white kraft board was obtained from 
International Paper. One such carton is shown in Fig. 3. Each carton was folded flat. 
[0051] The cartons were fed into a 3 hp Flinch Baugh shredder at a rate of approximately 15 to 20 pounds per hour. 
The shredder was equipped with two rotary blades, each 12" in length, two fixed blades, and a 0.3" discharge screen. 
The gap between the rotary and fixed blades was 0.10". 
[0052] A sample of the output from the shredder, consisting primarily of confetti-like pieces, about 0.1" to 0.5" in width 
and about 0.25" to 1" in length, is shown in Fig. 4. The shredder output was fed into a Thomas Wiley Mill Model 2D5 
rotary cutter. The rotary cutter had four rotary blades, four fixed blades, and a 2 mm discharge screen. Each blade was 
approximately 2" long. The blade gap was set at 0.020". 
[0053] The rotary cutter sheared the confetti-like pieces across the knife edges, tearing the pieces apart and releasing 
a finely texturized fiber at a rate of about one pound per hour. The fiber had an average minimum L/D ratio of between 
five and 100 or more. The bulk density of the texturized fiber was on the order of 0.1 g/cc. A sample of texturized fiber 
is shown in Fig. 5 at normal magnification, and in Fig. 2 at fifty-fold magnification. 

Example 2 

[0054] Composites of texturized fiber and resin were prepared as follows. A standard rubber/ plastic compounding 2-
roll mill was heated to 325-400°F. The resin (usually in the form of pellets or granules) was added to the heated roll mill. 
After about 5 to 10 minutes, the resin banded on the rolls (i.e., it melted and fused on the rolls). The coupling agent was 
then added to the roll mill. After another five minutes, the texturized cellulosic or lignocellulosic material was added to 
the molten resin/ coupling agent mixture. The cellulosic or lignocellulosic fiber was added over a period of about 10 minutes. 
[0055] The composite was then removed from the roll mill, cut into sheets, and allowed to cool to room temperature. 
Batches of about 80 g each were compression molded into 6" x 6" x 1/8" plaques using standard compression molding 
techniques. 
[0056] One composite contained the following ingredients:

calculated. The properties of Composition No. 1 are as follows:

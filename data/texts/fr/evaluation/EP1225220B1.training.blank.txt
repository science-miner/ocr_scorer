Description 

Field of the Invention 

[0001] The present invention relates to a method for eliminating Gal α1-3Gal structure from a swine tissue. 

Background Art 

[0002] Endo-β-galactosidase derived from Clostridium perfringens (hereinafter referred to as "endo-β-galactosidase 
C") is an enzyme that acts on the Galα1-&gt;3Galβ1-&gt;4GlcNAc sequence at a terminus of a glycoconjugate and digests 
the Galβ1-&gt;4GlcNAc linkage, but does not act on the Galα1-&gt;3 (Fucα1-&gt;2) Galβ1-&gt;4GlcNAc sequence (Japanese Patent 
Publication (Kokoku) No. 7-87783). This enzyme is useful as an analytical reagent. 
[0003] This enzyme can be prepared by culturing Clostridium perfringens. If a DNA coding for this enzyme is obtained, 
production of the enzyme in a further larger amount by a genetic engineering technique will become possible. There is 
also possibility of utilizing this enzyme for xenotransplantation as described later. 
[0004] JP63-52877 discloses an enzyme derived from a bacterium belonging to the genus Clostridium, capable of 
producing endo-β-galactosidase. JP63-52877 states that the substrate specificity is such that the enzymes acts on a 
part having Gal α1→3Gal β1→4GlcNAc sequence and cleaving Gal β1→4GlcNAc bond at the end and not on a part 
having Gal α1→3 (Fuc α1→2) Gal β1→4GlcNAc sequence at the end. JP63-52877 states that the enzyme is useful for 
analyzing saccharide chain structure of conjugated glucide existing in blood type substance of human erythrocytes. 
JP63-52877 provides a method for preparing the enzyme. 
[0005] JP10201472 discloses an α-galactosidase that is able to selectively form a α1-3 galactoside bond between a 
galactoside compound, to which a galactose is bonded, and a saccharide acceptor, and is able to synthesize a glucide 
that effectively suppresses hyperacute rejection in heterologous organ transplantation. The α-galactosidease provided 
by JP10201472 is preferably used for producing a glycide. It is derived from microorganisms that belong to Penicillium 
sp., such as Penicillium funiculosum, Aspergillus sp., such as Aspergillus oryzae, or Streptomyces sp., and has reactivity 
of the formula (R-OH is a galactose, a compound having a hydroxyl group, etc.), substrative specificity such as formation 
of Gal-α1-3Ga1-OR in a transfer reaction, optimum pH of 3.0-3.5, optimum temperature of 50 deg.C and molecular 
weight of 4,400. 
[0006] W09811246 relates to purified and isolated nucleic acid encoding the endo-β-galactosidase from Flavobacte-
rium keratolyticus ("ENDO-A"), and to purified ENDO-A protein. WO9811246 states that the endo-β-galactosidase of 
the invention may be used in a process which enzymatically de-antigenizes human erythrocytes bearing Al antigen. 
WO9811246 states that the resulting erythrocytes may be transfused into individuals who would be otherwise unable 
to tolerate a transfusion of type A1 blood. 
[0007] WO9104335 discloses digestion of Group B Streptococcus type III (GBS-III) polysaccharide capsule by reacting 
it with a bacterial endo-β-galactosidase that is specific for the galactose-glucose glycosidic linkage in the GBS-III CP 
backbone, and that substantially does not hydrolyse any other GBS-III CP glycosidic linkages. WO9104335 also discloses 
production of the endo-β-galactosidase from a multiphase culture. 

Disclosure of the Invention 

[0008] An object of the present invention is to provide a method for eliminating Gal α1-3Gal structure from a swine tissue. 
[0009] The inventors of the present invention assiduously studied in order to achieve the aforementioned object. As 
a result, they isolated a DNA coding for the endo-β-galactosidase C and elucidated its nucleotide sequence, and moreover, 
they confirmed that this DNA expressed the endo-β-galactosidase C having enzymatic activity. 
[0010] The present invention relates to a method for eliminating Gal α1-3Gal structure from a swine tissue, comprising 
treating the swine tissue with endo-β-galactosidase C. 
[0011] The inventors have identified DNA and protein suitable for use in the above method, i.e. the inventors identified 
a DNA coding for a protein defined in the following (A) or (B): 

(A) a protein that comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2; 
(B) a protein that comprises an amino acid sequence having an amino acid sequence of (A) including substitution, 
deletion, insertion or transposition of one or several amino acids and has endo-β-galactosidase activity. 

[0012] The inventors identified the aforementioned DNA, wherein the protein having an amino acid sequence of (A) 
includes substitution, deletion, insertion or transposition of one or several amino acids and having endo-β-galactosidase 
activity is a protein having the amino acid sequence represented by the amino acid numbers 35 to 845 in SEQ ID NO: 2. 
[0013] Preferred examples of such a DNA include a DNA defined in the following (a) or (b): 


EP 1 225 220 B1

5 





















(a) a DNA that comprises the nucleotide sequence of the nucleotide numbers 246 to 2780 in SEQ ID NO: 1; 
(b) a DNA that is hybridizable with a DNA having all or a part of a nucleotide sequence complementary to the 
nucleotide sequence of the nucleotide numbers 246 to 2780 in SEQ ID NO: 1 under the stringent conditions, and 
codes for a protein having endo-β-galactosidase activity. 

[0014] Preferred examples of the aforementioned DNA further include a DNA defined in the following (a) or (b): 

(a) a DNA that comprises the nucleotide sequence of the nucleotide numbers 348 to 2780 in SEQ ID NO: 1; 
(b) a DNA that is hybridizable with a DNA having all or a part of a nucleotide sequence complementary to the 
nucleotide sequence of the nucleotide numbers 348 to 2780 in SEQ ID NO: 1 under stringent conditions, and codes 
for a protein having endo-β-galactosidase activity. 

[0015] In the present invention, endo-β-galactosidase activity refers to an activity for catalyzing a reaction of cleaving 
a Galβ1-&gt;4GlcNAc linkage of Galα1-&gt;3Galβ1-&gt;4GlcNAc sequence at a terminus of glycoconjugate. 
[0016] Hereafter, the present invention will be described in detail. 

DNA used in the present invention 

[0017] The DNA used in the present invention is a DNA coding for a protein defined in the following (A) or (B): 

(A) a protein that comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2; 
(B) a protein that comprises an amino acid sequence having an amino acid sequence of (A) including substitution, 
deletion, insertion or transposition of one or several amino acids and has endo-β-galactosidase activity. 

[0018] Especially, a DNA coding for the protein defined in (A) is preferred. 
[0019] In the present specification, the expression "a protein that comprises an amino acid sequence including sub-
stitution, deletion, insertion or transposition of one or several amino acids and has endo-β-galactosidase activity" means 
that the protein may include substitution, deletion, insertion or transposition of one or several amino acid residues that 
does not substantially impair activity for acting on the Galα1-&gt;3Galβ1-&gt;4GlcNAc sequence at a terminus of a glycocon-
jugate to cleave the Galβ1-&gt;4GlcNAc linkage (endo-β-galactosidase activity). 
[0020] That is, it is known that, in a naturally occurring protein, a mutation such as substitution, deletion, insertion or 
transposition of an amino acid can occur in the amino acid sequence due to polymorphism or mutation of DNA coding 
for it as well as a modification reaction of a produced protein in an living body or during purification, but, in spite of such 
a mutation, there may be such a protein still having physiological and biological activities substantially equivalent to 
those of a protein having no mutation. The DNA used in the present invention also includes a DNA coding for a protein 
that has some structural differences, but does not show significant functional difference. 
[0021] Similarly, the DNA used in the present invention also includes a DNA obtained by artificially introducing such 
a mutation as described above into a DNA coding for a protein, and more various and diverse mutants can be prepared 
in such a case. For example, it is known that a protein obtained by replacing a certain cysteine residue with a serine 
residue in an amino acid sequence in human interleukin 2 (IL-2) has IL-2 activity (Science, 224, 1431 (1984)). Further, 
some kinds of proteins are known to have a peptide region that is not necessary for activity. Examples of such proteins 
include a signal peptide present in a protein secreted outside a cell, a pro-sequence observed in a precursor of protease 
or the like. Most of such regions are eliminated after translation or at the time of conversion into an active protein. Such 
proteins exist in a different form as for the primary structure, but the proteins ultimately have an equivalent function. A 
DNA coding for any of such proteins is also included in the DNA used in the present invention. For example, a protein 
having the amino acid sequence of the amino acid numbers 35 to 845 in SEQ ID NO: 2 is a protein that lacks a region 
corresponding to the amino acid numbers 1 to 34 (considered to correspond to a signal sequence), but has endo-β-
galactosidase activity. Therefore, a DNA coding for such a protein is also included in the DNA of the present invention. 
[0022] The expression "several amino acids" used in the present specification refers to about 2 to 40, preferably 2 to 
20, more preferably 2 to 10, of amino acids, when a protein consists of, for example, 800 amino acid residues. 
[0023] The endo-β-galactosidase activity can be determined by, for example, a determination method utilizing a swine 
erythrocyte or vascular endothelial cell (the Galα1-&gt;3Galβ1-&gt;4GlcNAc sequence is present on its surface) and lectin 
that specifically recognizes the Galα1-&gt;3Gal structure as shown in the examples described later. Further, as shown in 
the examples described later, the endo-β-galactosidase activity can also be determined by allowing an enzymatic reaction 
using Galα1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4Glc or the like as a substrate, and analyzing the enzymatic reaction product 
by thin layer chromatography (TLC), mass spectrometry or the like. Therefore, those skilled in the art can readily select 
substitution, deletion, insertion or transposition of one or several amino acids that does not substantially impair the endo-
β-galactosidase activity by using presence or absence of the activity as an indicator.

[0024] The substitution, deletion, insertion or transposition of one or several amino acid residues that does not sub-
stantially impair the endo-β-galactosidase activity can occur under a natural condition, or can be obtained by artificially 
introducing substitution, deletion, insertion or transposition of a nucleotide or nucleotides that would induce such sub-
stitution, deletion, insertion or transposition into a DNA coding for the amino acid sequence. The substitution, deletion, 
insertion or transposition of a nucleotide or nucleotides can be introduced into a DNA by synthesizing a sequence that 
has restriction enzyme-digested termini at both ends and includes both sides of a mutation point, and replacing a region 
corresponding to a nucleotide sequence of unmutated DNA with it. Further, substitution, deletion, insertion or transposition 
of a nucleotide or nucleotides can also be introduced by the site specific mutagenesis (Kramer, W. and Frits, H.J., Meth. 
in Enzymol., 154, 350 (1987); Kunkel, T.A. et al., Meth. in Enzymol., 154, 367 (1987)) or the like. 
[0025] As the DNA used in the present invention, a DNA including the nucleotide sequence represented by the nu-
cleotide numbers 246 to 2780 in SEQ ID NO: 1 can be specifically exemplified and is preferred. Further, the DNA of the 
present invention may be a DNA that is hybridizable with a DNA having all or a part of a nucleotide sequence comple-
mentary to the nucleotide sequence of the nucleotide numbers 246 to 2780 in SEQ ID NO: 1 under the stringent conditions 
so long as the encoded protein has the endo-β-galactosidase activity. The "stringent conditions" referred to herein are 
conditions under which a so-called specific hybrid is formed, but a non-specific hybrid is not formed (refer to Sambrook, 
J. et al., Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1989) etc.). 
The "stringent conditions" include a condition used in usual gene hybridization, for example, a condition used in Southern 
blotting, Northern blotting or screening using hybridization or the like. Specifically, the stringent conditions are exemplified 
by a condition for hybridization at 42°C in the presence of 50% formamide, 5 x SSPE (20 x SSPC: 3.6 M sodium chloride, 
0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.7), 20 mM EDTA disodium), 5 x Denhardt's solution and 0.1% SDS. 
[0026] It will be easily understood by those skilled in the art that a DNA having a different nucleotide sequence due 
to degeneracy of genetic code is included in the DNA used in the present invention so long as the DNA codes for 
substantially the same amino acid sequence as the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2. 
[0027] The DNA used in the present invention also includes a DNA or RNA complementary to the DNA disclosed 
above. Further, the DNA used in the present invention may be single-stranded DNA comprising only a coding strand 
coding for the endo-β-galactosidase C or doublestranded DNA comprising such a single-stranded DNA and a DNA 
strand or RNA strand having a nucleotide sequence complementary to it. 
[0028] The DNA used in the present invention having the nucleotide sequence shown in the SEQ ID NO: 1 is originally 
derived from Clostridium perfringens. However, its origin is not limited, and a DNA prepared by a genetic engineering 
technique, chemical synthesis or the like is included as a matter of course. Further, even a DNA obtained by ligating the 
DNA used in the present invention to a DNA having a certain function or coding for another protein or the like is also 
included in the DNA used in the present invention so long as it contains the DNA used in the present invention. In the 
nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, "t" of the nucleotide number 660 may be "c", and the 139th amino acid residue, 
"Ser", may be "Pro" in the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NOS: 1 and 2. In either case, such a DNA is included 
in the DNA used in the present invention so long as the encoded protein has the endo-β-galactosidase activity. 
[0029] The DNA used in the present invention was obtained by the following genetic engineering technique. 

(1) A partial amino acid sequence of purified endo-β-galactosidase C (Japanese Patent Publication No. 7-87783) 
is analyzed, and PCR primers are prepared based on the sequence. 
(2) PCR is performed by using the primers obtained in (1) and genomic DNA of Clostridium perfringens as a template 
to obtain a partial fragment of cDNA coding for endo-β-galactosidase C. 
(3) Cassette PCR is performed by using the partial cDNA obtained in (2) to further obtain regions on the 5' and 3' 
end sides. 
(4) Primers for obtaining a full length cDNA are prepared based on the information obtained in (3) and a full length 
cDNA is obtained by PCR and analyzed for its nucleotide sequence. 

[0030] The origin for collecting the DNA used in the present invention is not particularly limited so long as it codes for 
the endo-β-galactosidase C. Specifically, Clostridium perfringens ATCC 10873 can be mentioned. This bacterial strain 
is available from the American Type Culture Collection (12301, Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Maryland 20852 U.S.A). 
Further, this bacterial strain was deposited by the applicant of the present application at the National Institute of Bioscience 
and Human-Technology, the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry, and received an accession number of FERM P-8917. 
[0031] The DNA described above and endo-β-galactosidase to be prepared with it can be used for xenotransplantation. 
That is, a sugar chain having a Galα1-3Gal structure (α-galactose antigen) exists in swine tissues or the like, but does 
not exist in human tissues. Therefore, when a swine tissue is transplanted to a human, rejection occurs. Accordingly, if 
the Galα1-3Gal structure is eliminated from a swine tissue by treating the swine tissue with the endo-β-galactosidase 
prepared by using the DNA of the present invention, or a swine (clone swine or the like) that does not express the 
Galα1-3Gal structure is produced by introducing the DNA of the present invention into a swine cell (ES cell or the like), 


EP 1 225 220 B1

they can be used for xenotransplantation. 
[0032] The main antigen responsible for hyperacute rejection in xenotransplantation is the α-galactose antigen present 
on cell surfaces. The α-galactose antigen is an antigen having the Galαl-3Gal structure. In old world monkeys including 
humans, the Galα1-3Gal structure is not present at sugar chain termini of glycoproteins or glycolipids. Therefore, strong 
natural antibodies directed to this structure are produced. Since most mammals, including swine, have the Galα1-3Gal 
structure, the natural antibodies bind to the antigens on vascular endothelial cells, thus complement-dependent hyper-
acute rejection is induced and a blood vessel is destroyed, when, for example, a swine organ is transplanted to a human. 
[0033] The method of the present invention prevents hyperacute rejection of transplant tissue by eliminating the α-
galactose antigens by the action of endo-β-galactosidase to such an extent that acute rejection due to the antigens 
should be eliminated. 
[0034] The endo-β-galactosidase is not particularly limited so long as the enzyme can eliminate the α-galactose 
antigens (Galα1-3Gal structure), but an enzyme that can eliminate the α-galactose antigen from the 
Galα1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc structure is preferred. Among such enzymes, endo-β-galactosidase C is preferred in view of its 
efficiency of enzymatic action, optimum pH close to neutral, effective actions even at low temperature and so forth. In 
particular, an endo-β-galactosidase C prepared by the DNA as discussed above can be preferably used. 
[0035] Preferably, the method of the present invention is used for treatment of an organ for transplantation and treatment 
of an organ expressing α-galactose antigens. Further, an organ treated with the endo-β-galactosidase for treatment of 
the present invention is preferably transplanted to a mammal that does not have the α-galactose antigens on its cell 
surfaces. 
[0036] In particular, the organ for transplantation treated with the endo-β-galactosidase for treatment of the present 
invention is preferably a swine organ, of which use for xenotransplantation to a human is expected, particularly preferably 
an organ to be transplanted to a human. Further, as such an organ, kidney, liver, heart, lung and so forth can be 
exemplified, but kidney is preferred. 
[0037] The method of the present invention can use an endo-β-galactosidase in the form of a pharmaceutical which 
can be appropriately selected for use in the method of the present invention. For example, the endo-β-galactosidase 
can be prepared as a liquid endo-β-galactosidase, perfusion endo-β-galactosidase, solid endo-β-galactosidase dissolved 
at the time of use and so forth. 
[0038] For example, when the endo-β-galactosidase for use in the method of the present invention is provided as a 
liquid agent, the endo-β-galactosidase may be either in a solution or in a frozen state. This can be filled and sealed in 
an appropriate container such as a bottle or chemical bag and distributed or stored until use as it is. 
[0039] When the endo-β-galactosidase is provided as a solid, the form is not limited so long as the endo-β-galactosidase 
is stable, but, for example, lyophilized endo-β-galactosidase, spray-dried endo-β-galactosidase or the like can be ex-
emplified. 
[0040] Known methods can be used for preparation of the endo-β-galactosidase for use in the method of the present 
invention. At the time of the preparation as a pharmaceutical, ingredients usually used for drugs such as other pharma-
ceutically active ingredients, conventionally used excipients, stabilizers, binders, lubricants, emulsifiers, osmotic regu-
lators, pH regulators, buffers, isotonic agents, preservatives, coloring agents and disintegrators can be used, so long 
as they should not adversely affect the endo-β-galactosidase and an effect obtained by treatment with the endo-β-
galactosidase should not be affected. 
[0041] The endo-β-galactosidase for use in the method of the present invention can be used for the purpose of 
suppression of hyperacute rejection upon transplantation of an organ. That is, the endo-β-galactosidase for use in the 
method of the present invention is extremely preferably used in order to suppress hyperacute rejection upon xenotrans-
plantation of kidney. 
[0042] By perfusing an organ extracted for organ transplantation with the endo-β-galactosidase for use in the method 
of the present invention, and further holding and storing the extracted organ in contact with the endo-β-galactosidase 
or the like, the α-galactose antigens present on vascular endothelial cells of the organ are eliminated by the action of 
endo-β-galactosidase, and thus the hyperacute rejection upon transplantation can be suppressed. 
[0043] Further, the endo-β-galactosidase can be used for not only an organ already extracted for transplantation, but 
also an organ to be extracted for transplantation. For example, an organ may be extracted in the endo-β-galactosidase 
by perfusing or filling an organ to be extracted and surrounding thereof with the endo-β-galactosidase for treatment of 
the present invention. 
[0044] The amount of endo-β-galactosidase blended in the endo-β-galactosidase or the like should be individually 
determined depending on the method for using the endo-β-galactosidase, type, size, state, storage time and temperature 
of an organ to be stored and so forth, and it is not particularly limited. However, about 0.05-5 unit/ml (about 0.005-0.5 
mg/ml) in a state of a liquid agent can be exemplified. The definition of "unit" will be described later. In an amount of 
0.1-2 unit/ml (about 0.01-0.2 mg/ml) is preferred, and about 0.4-0.5 unit/ml (0.04-0.05 mg/ml) is extremely preferred. 
[0045] Further, temperature of the endo-β-galactosidase at the time of organ treatment can also be individually de-
termined depending on the method of use or the like. However, preferred is a temperature at which the endo-β-galac-


EP 1 225 220 B1

tosidase is not frozen and can be maintained in a solution state, functions of organ can be maintained and enzymatic 
activity of the endo-β-galactosidase can be maintained. The endo-β-galactosidase C is preferred, because it effectively 
acts even at a low temperature. In this case, a low temperature, for example, about 4°C, is preferably used. 
[0046] An organ from which the α-galactose antigens are eliminated can be obtained by treating an organ expressing 
the α-galactose antigens with the endo-β-galactosidase. The expression "α-galactose antigens are eliminated" used 
herein does not means that all of the α-galactose antigens present in the organ need to be eliminated, but means that 
the α-galactose antigens may be eliminated to such an extent that hyperacute rejection should not substantially be 
induced. Specifically, it is preferred that α-galactose antigens present on vascular endothelial cells of an organ are 
substantially eliminated by perfusing the organ expressing the α-galactose antigens with the agent for treatment of the 
present invention. 
[0047] Since no histological change was observed in kidneys treated with the endo-β-galactosidase C as shown in 
the examples described later, safety of the endo-β-galactosidase and the organ obtained using the method is strongly 
suggested.

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention 

[0049] Hereafter, the present invention will be further specifically explained with reference to the following examples. 

&lt;1&gt; Analysis of partial amino acid sequence of endo-β-galactosidase C and preparation of PCR primers 

[0050] According to the method described in Japanese Patent Publication No. 7-87783 and J. Biol. Chem., 262, 
10086-10092 (1987) , proteins were purified from culture broth of Clostridium perfringens (ATCC10873, FERM P-8917) 
by salting out with ammonium sulfate, Sephadex G-200 (Pharmacia) column chromatography and following DEAE-
Sephadex A-25 (Pharmacia) column chromatography. The purified proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis (PAGE), and the gel after the electrophoresis was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. A band corre-
sponding to a molecular weight of 90,000 was excised and digested with trypsin, and the digested fragments were 
separated by high speed liquid chromatography, and partial amino acid sequence of each fragment was analyzed by a 
protein sequencer ABI 494A (ABI). As a result, the following four kinds of amino acid sequences were obtained.

Prism 377 DNA sequencer (ABI). As a result, a partial cDNA (1946 bp) containing sequences that encoded the afore-
mentioned four kinds of amino acid sequences could be obtained. 

&lt;3&gt; Cassette PCR using partial cDNA obtained above 

[0054] Further, in order to obtain regions on the 5' side and 3' side of the obtained cDNA, cassette PCR was performed

[0058] The obtained product was ligated to pGEM-T Easy Vector Systems (Promega), and the nucleotide sequence

&lt;5&gt; Expression of enzyme using cDNA and assay of enzymatic activity 

(1) Expression of enzyme 

[0061] cDNA of the coding region was ligated to an EcoRI/ XhoI site of pcDSA expression vector incorporated with 
IgM signal peptide and protein A genes and having SR promoter (FEBS Letters, 360, pp. 1-4 (1995) ; J. Biol. Chem., 269 
(2), pp. 1402-1409 (1994) ). The obtained plasmid was transfected into COS-7 cells by using LIPOFECT AMINE PLUS 
Reagent (Gibco BRL). The transfection was performed in DMEM medium that did not contain FCS. 
[0062] The cells after the transfection were cultured (10 cm dish x 48) in DMEM medium containing 2% fetal calf serum 
(FCS) from which IgG was removed by adsorption with Protein A Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia). The culture broth was 
recovered after 3 days, then the cells were cultured in fresh medium for further 5 days, and then the culture broth was 
recovered. 
[0063] The recovered culture broth (about 800 ml) was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes, and the supernatant 
was filtered through a 0.8-Pm filter. The filtered supernatant in an amount of 100 ml each was passed through IgG 
Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (Pharmacia, 6.5 mm x 10 mm) to collect the adsorbed fraction. The collected adsorbed fraction 
was concentrated by using Centricon 10 (Amicon) and stored at -80°C. 

(2) Assay of enzymatic activity 

[0064] Sugar chains (galactose antigen) that have the Galα1-3Gal structure and serve as a substrate of endo-β-
galactosidase C exist on swine erythrocyte surfaces. By utilizing them, the endo-β-galactosidase C activity was assayed 
as follows. 

(i) Preparation of swine erythrocytes 

[0065] Blood was collected from swine and blood cells were obtained by centrifugation. The blood cells were washed 
three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS (-)) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The washed blood 
cells were added with 3 mg/ml of dimethyl suberimidate dihydrochloride (DMS, dissolved in a buffer containing 0.1 M 
Na 2 CO 3 , 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), pH 10.3) and incubated at 37°C for 20 
minutes. Then, the blood cells were washed twice with PBS (-) containing 0.02% EDTA (pH 7.4), and the blood cells 
were sufficiently suspended in PBS (-) containing 0.2% BSA to prepare 1% blood cell suspension. 

(ii) Assay of enzymatic activity 

[0066] The blood cells (50 Pl of 1% blood cell suspension) prepared in (i) was put into a tube and centrifuged at 2,000 
rpm for 1 minute. The supernatant was removed, and the precipitates (blood cells) was added with and suspended in 
100 Pl of PBS (-) containing 0.2% BSA, and added with a solution (1 Pl or 8 Pl) of the enzyme expressed in the above 
(1) or PBS (-) as a control. Then, the blood cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 to 2 hours. 
[0067] After the incubation, the blood cells were washed twice with PBS (-) containing 0.2% BSA and re-suspended 
in 50 Pl of the same buffer. This suspension in an amount of 25 Pl was added with 25Pl of FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) 
labeled GS-IB 4 (lectin that binds to Galα1-3Gal structure, derived from Griffonia simplicifolia, Sigma) diluted 50 times 
with PBS (-) containing 0.2% BSA, and incubated for 30 minutes under ice cooling. Then, the blood cells were washed 
with PBS (-) containing 0.2% BSA, re-suspended in 0.5 ml of the same buffer, and analyzed by a fluorescence activated 
cell sorter (FACS). The results are shown in Fig. 1. 
[0068] As a result, when the swine erythrocytes and the expressed enzyme were brought into contact with each other, 
fluorescence intensity of FITC was decreased (Fig. 1, B) compared with the control (Fig. 1, A). Further, when the amount 
of the expressed enzyme to be contacted was increased, the fluorescence intensity of FITC was further decreased (Fig. 
1, C). This indicated that the expressed enzyme had the endo-β-galactosidase C activity and the binding of the FITC-
labeled GS-IB 4 to the swine erythrocyte surfaces was decreased as a result of excision of the sugar chains having the 
Galα1-3Gal structure on the swine erythrocyte surfaces. This result demonstrated that the DNA of the present invention 
coded for endo-β-galactosidase C actually having the enzymatic activity. Moreover, it was also demonstrated that the 
recombinant vector of the present invention prepared by using the DNA of the present invention, the transformant of the 
present invention prepared by using the recombinant vector of the present invention and the production method of the 
present invention using the transformant of the present invention were actually practical and useful. Furthermore, it was 
also demonstrated that the α-galactose antigens could be removed by a treatment with endo-β-galactosidase.

&lt;6&gt; Mass expression of enzyme using Escherichia coli, assay of enzymatic activity and application to xenotransplantation 

[0069] In the following experiments, the enzymatic reaction was performed in 10 Pl of 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 
7.2) containing 20 Pg of Galα1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4Glc (Calbiochem). After incubation at 37°C for 30 minutes, 
the reaction was terminated by addition of 20 Pl of ethanol. 

(1) Production of recombinant endo-β-galactosidase C using Escherichia coli 

[0070] The aforementioned cDNA including the coding region was ligated to an expression vector pFLAG-Shift 12 
(Sigma), which produced a gene product secreted in periplasm. This allows that the enzyme should be expressed as a 
periplasmic enzyme in Escherichia coli (E. coli) under control of ompA gene. E. coli BL-12 cells were transformed with 
the above recombinant gene and cultured at 37°C in 2 L of LB medium containing 50 Pg/mL of ampicillin and 0.4% 
glucose, and 0.1 mM IPTG (isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside) was added to the medium to induce expression of the 
enzyme. After 30 minutes, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 10 minutes, washed twice with 300 
mL of Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at room temperature, and further washed with 300 mL of a solution containing 0.5 M sucrose, 
30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mM EDTA. 
[0071] The cells collected by centrifugation were suspended in 250 mL of pure water cooled with ice so that the enzyme 
should be released from periplasm. The suspension was centrifuged at 3,500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to collect a 
supernatant containing the released enzyme, and the enzyme fraction was purified by column chromatography using 
Sephadex G-200 (Pharmacia, 2.7 x 100 cm) and DEAE-Sephadex A-25 (Pharmacia, 1.0 x 10 cm) according to the 
method described in J. Biol. Chem., 262, pp. 10086-10092 (1987) . The purified enzyme fraction contained about 700 Pg 
of the protein. The above procedure was repeated to produce a large amount of the enzyme. 
[0072] The purified enzyme fraction was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE, 8% gel). 
As a result, a major band having an apparent molecular weight of 95 kDa and a minor band (97 kDa) adjacent to the 
major band were identified. The N-terminus amino acid sequence of the major band (95 kDa) was analyzed and found 
to be DENEYVL (in single letter code, equivalent to the amino acid numbers 35-41 in SEQ ID NO: 2). Moreover, a cluster 
of hydrophobic amino acids typically found in a signal sequence existed in the segment of the amino acid numbers 1-34 
in SEQ ID NO: 2. Based on these, it is thought that the segment of the amino acid numbers 1-34 in SEQ ID NO: 2 should 
be a signal sequence, and it is thought that the major band (95 kDa) is a protein lacking in that signal sequence (protein 
having an amino acid sequence represented by the amino acid numbers 35-845 in SEQ ID NO: 2). Further, based on 
the difference of the molecular weights, it is considered that the minor band (97 kDa) is a protein having a signal sequence. 

(2) Assay of endo-β-galactosidase C 

[0073] The enzymatic reaction was performed by using 4 mU of endo-β-galactosidase C in the same manner as 
described above. 
[0074] After the reaction was terminated, the solution after the reaction was desalted with Dowex 50W x 2H + form 
and 1 x 2 acetate form, and then 1/10 amount of hydrolysate was spotted on a Silica Gel 60 TLC plate (Merck). 
[0075] Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed for the plate by development with n-propanol: ethyl acetate: 
H 2 O (7: 2: 1), and the plate was sprayed with orcinol-sulfuric acid reagent and heated so that spots of sugars should 
emerge (J. Neurochem., 1, pp. 42-53 (1956) ). The amounts of the released products were determined by a densitometer 
(Gel Doc 1000, BIO-RAD). Under this assay condition, the enzymatic activity is proportional to the amount of the enzyme 
and reaction time until 40% of the substrate is hydrolyzed. Further, enzymatic activity of "1 Unit" is defined as an amount 
of the enzyme required for hydrolyzing 1 Pmole of the substrate in 1 minute under the aforementioned conditions of the 
enzymatic reaction. 
[0076] As a result, the recombinant enzyme obtained in the aforementioned (1) hydrolyzed the pentasaccharide 
(Galα1-3Ga1β1-4GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4Glc) and released two kinds of oligosaccharides, which were separated by TLC. 
[0077] Then, in order to identify these oligosaccharides, electrospray mass spectrometry was performed. 
[0078] Galα1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4Glc (20 Pg) was hydrolyzed with 4 mU of the enzyme at 37°C for 30 minutes 
in 10 Pl of 30 mM NaCl. After the enzymatic reaction was terminated with 20 Pl of ethanol, the reaction mixture was 
mixed with 1.5-fold amount of 83% acetonitrile containing 17 mM ammonium acetate. The mass spectrometry was 
performed by using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, API 300 (Perkin Elmer Sciex Instruments), equipped with 
an electrospray ion source. A sample was directly injected into the electrospray ion source at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/ hour. 
The spray was obtained with a potential difference of 4.8 kV. 
[0079] As a result, m/z of 892.2 was obtained as the result of analysis of the pentasaccharide before the enzymatic 
digestion. This value corresponds to a number obtained by adding 23 to the theoretical molecular weight of the pen-
tasaccharide, and it is thought that the value was obtained due to addition of Na + ion. As a result of analysis of the 
oligosaccharides after the enzymatic digestion, two of marked peaks were obtained at positions of m/z = 568.1 and m/z

= 365.0. The former mass corresponds to that obtained by adding Na + to GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4Glc, and the latter mass 
corresponds to that obtained by adding Na + to Galal-3Gal. 
[0080] Based on these results, it was confirmed that the cloned enzyme should be endo-β-galactosidase C and it 
should hydrolyze the Galβ1-4GlcNAc linkage to release Galα1-3Gal disaccharide. Moreover, this enzyme showed a 
specific activity of 10.5 U/mg protein, and thus it was demonstrated that the enzyme had strong activity. The protein 
amount of the purified enzyme was determined by using Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) and bovine serum 
albumin as a standard. 
[0081] Further, contamination of other glycosidases in the purified enzyme fraction was determined by using a p-
nitrophenyl glycoside for each enzyme as a substrate, which was incubated with 29.4 Pg of the purified enzyme at 37°C 
for 1 hour in 0.2 mL of a reaction mixture at pH 7.0 (50 mM phosphate buffer) and pH 6.0 (50 mM citrate-phosphate 
buffer). Further, contamination of proteases was similarly determined by the method described in J. Biochem., 75, pp. 
707-714 (1974) under the conditions of pH 7.0 and pH 6.0. 
[0082] As a result, the purified enzyme fraction did not substantially contain any of protease, α-galactosidase, β-
galactosidase and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. Moreover, this recombinant enzyme showed an optimum pH in the range 
of 7.0-8.0, and it was the same as the optimum pH of the enzyme obtained from culture broth of C. perfringens (J. Biol. 
Chem., 262, pp. 10086-10092 (1987) ). Furthermore, enzymatic activity of this enzyme at 4°C was about 40% of the 
activity at 37°C. 

(3) Application to xenotransplantation 

[0083] In the following descriptions, "PBS/BSA" means PBS (-) containing 0.2% BSA. 

(3-1) Removal of α-galactose antigens from viable cells 

[0084] Swine erythrocytes were prepared in the same manner as in the above &lt;5&gt;. Swine vascular endothelial cells 
were isolated from swine by the method described in Transplantation, 62, pp. 105-113 (1996) . These cells were collected 
with Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco BRL), washed twice with PBS/BSA, and suspended in PBS/BSA again. The endo-β-galac-
tosidase C obtained in the above (1) (70 mU in 7 Pl of PBS) was added to the vascular endothelial cells (2 x 10 5 cells/ 
50 Pl), and the enzymatic reaction was performed at 37°C for 1 hour. 
[0085] After the enzymatic reaction, the erythrocytes or the endothelial cells were washed twice with PBS/BSA and 
allowed to react with FITC-labeled GS-IB 4 or human blood serum. In the case of the former, the cells were suspended 
in 50 Pl of PBS/BSA containing 1 Pg of FITC-GS-IB 4 (Sigma) and maintained for 30 minutes under ice cooling. In the 
case of the latter, the washed cells were incubated with 100 Pl of normal human serum collected from 50 of healthy 
volunteers and pooled (diluted with PBS/BSA at a ratio of 1: 1). After incubation for 30 minutes under ice cooling, the 
cells were washed twice with PBS/BSA and incubated with 100 Pl of FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-human IgG, IgM or 
IgA (Dako, each diluted with PBS/BSA at a ratio of 1: 20) for 30 minutes under ice cooling. FITC-conjugated mouse 
monoclonal anti-human IgG 1 (Zymed), IgG 2 , IgG 3 or IgG 4 (Sigma) was also used. 
[0086] The stained erythrocytes or endothelial cells were washed twice with PBS/BSA, suspended in 0.5 mL of 
PBS/BSA, and analyzed by FACS (FACS Calibur, Becton Dickinson). 

(3-2) Assay of complement-dependent cytotoxicity 

[0087] The swine vascular endothelial cells were inoculated onto a 96-well culture plate in an amount of 1 x 10 4 cells/ 
well one day before the assay. The cells were washed with PBS (-) and then incubated at 37°C in 50 Pl of Dulbecco's 
modified Eagle medium containing 70 mU of endo-β-galactosidase C obtained in the above (1) for 2 hours. The control 
cells were incubated under no enzyme condition. The cells were washed twice and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour with 
25% or 50% of normal human serum (50 Pl) diluted with PBS (-). As for the human blood serum, one collected from 10 
of healthy volunteers and pooled was used. After incubation, survival of the cells was determined by an assay utilizing 
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma) according to the method described in Bio-
chem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 232, pp. 731-736 (1997) . Absorbance was measured at 540 nm for each well by using an 
automatic plate reader (EAR340, SLT-Labinstruments) and defined as "survival of cells under existence of complement". 
"Survival of cells under absence of complement" was also determined for each assay by using blood serum that was 
treated at 56°C for 30 minutes to inactivate the complement. The complement-dependent cytotoxicity was calculated 
according to the following equation. The experiments were performed in triplicate.

[0088] The results of the above experiments are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. 
[0089] Fig. 2 shows attenuations of the properties of GS-IB 4 and human immunoglobulin for binding to the swine cells 
treated with the recombinant endo-β-galactosidase C. A and C show the results of the experiments using erythrocytes, 
and B and D show the results of the experiments using vascular endothelial cells. The thick lines in the figures represent 
the results obtained after the enzyme treatment, and normal lines represent the results obtained before the enzyme 
treatment. 
[0090] Further, Fig. 3 shows the effect of endo-β-galactosidase C on the complement-dependent cytotoxicity. In Fig. 
3, the hatched bars represent the results obtained without the enzymatic treatment, and the black bars represent the 
results obtained with enzymatic treatment, respectively. Averages of results of assays performed in triplicate are shown 
with standard errors. 
[0091] After the treatment with the recombinant endo-β-galactosidase C, 99% or more of α-galactose antigens (rec-
ognized by FITC-GS-IB 4 ) were removed from the swine erythrocytes (Fig. 2A). Similarly, 98% of the α-galactosyl epitopes 
were enzymatically removed from the swine vascular endothelial cells (Fig. 2B). The binding of IgM to erythrocytes 
treated with the enzyme was decreased to 25% of the cells that were not treated (Fig. 2A). Moreover, as for the endothelial 
cells, it decreased to 23% or less (Fig. 2B). The binding of IgA and IgG in human blood serum to the endothelial cells 
treated with the enzyme similarly decreased to 21% and 33%, respectively (Fig. 2B). There was comparatively little 
decrease of the binding of IgG to erythrocytes treated with the enzyme (Fig. 2A). 
[0092] Furthermore, as a result of use of antibodies to human IgG subclass, the bindings of IgG 1 , IgG 2 and IgG 3 to 
the treated cells were markedly decreased (Figs. 2C and 2D). On the other hand, the binding of IgG 4 did not change. 
The cells treated with endo-β-galactosidase C showed decreased sensitivity to the complement-dependent cytotoxicity 
caused by human blood serum (Fig. 3). 

(3-3) Treatment of swine renal vessel with endo-β-galactosidase C by ex vivo perfusion 

[0093] Kidneys were extracted by a usual surgical procedure from female swine obtained by heterogenous mating of 
Landrace/ Yorkshire (Oguri Chikusan, body weight of 10-12 kg) after perfusion of the kidneys with physiological saline 
and University of Wisconsin (UW) solution (Transplantation, 45, pp. 673-676 (1988) ). Right kidneys were perfused ex 
vivo twice with a flow of 100 mL of cold UW solution containing 45.1 units of endo-β-galactosidase C formed by gravity 
(1 x g). Perfusion of left kidneys was performed without the enzyme. The kidneys of the both sides were stored at 4°C 
in the perfusates for 4 hours. A lower temperature is preferred for storage of tissues and the endo-β-galactosidase C 
effectively act also at a low temperature. Therefore, the reaction was allowed at 4°C. 
[0094] Biopsy was performed immediately after the points 1 hour and 4 hours after the perfusion. Subsequently, each 
kidney was perfused twice with 100 mL of fresh frozen human plasma collected from 3 of healthy volunteers. 
[0095] For histological study, each sample obtained by the biopsy was fixed with formalin, and stained by hematoxylin/ 
eosine and periodic acid-Schiff staining. The sample was immediately frozen again in liquid nitrogen, stained with FITC-
GS-IB 4 , and observed with a fluorescence microscope. 
[0096] In this observation, it was confirmed that α-galactose antigens that had existed in the lumens of vascular 
endothelial cells were actually removed by the enzymatic reaction at 4°C for 4 hours through the staining with FITC-GS-
IB 4 . Any histological change was not observed for kidneys treated with the enzyme. 
[0097] Furthermore, the human plasma used for the perfusion was collected, and the level of remaining immunoglobulin 
was analyzed by using the aforementioned swine erythrocytes in FACS. 
[0098] This was done in order to investigate whether the binding of immunoglobulin in human plasma to vessels 
treated with the enzyme was decreased by the above method of removing α-galactose antigens in situ as in the case 
of vascular endothelial cells or erythrocytes. Although it is possible to quantitatively determine separated cells by using 
FACS, it is not easy to directly measure the amount of immunoglobulin binding in an intact vessel. Therefore, it was 
decided to measure decrease of the binding activity of immunoglobulin to swine erythrocytes after the perfusion of the 
kidneys. In order to prevent dispersion among swine individuals, two kidneys extracted from the same individual were 


EP 1 225 220 B1

5 





















used. The right kidney was treated with endo-β-galactosidase C, and the left kidney was perfused with a solution not 
containing the enzyme. Subsequently, perfusion was performed with human plasma (100 mL) under gravity. 
[0099] The perfused human plasma was collected, allowed to react with swine erythrocytes, and then allowed to react 
with FITC-conjugated antibodies directed to human immunoglobulin. The stained erythrocytes were analyzed by FACS. 
The results are shown in Fig. 4. The results are shown with relative values based on the average fluorescence intensity 
obtained in the case utilizing the plasma before the perfusion, which was taken as 100%. 
[0100] In Fig. 4, the white bars indicate the results obtained by using the plasma before the perfusion, the hatched 
bars indicate the results obtained when the perfusion was performed only with a solution not containing the enzyme, 
and the black bars indicate the results obtained when the perfusion was performed with a solution containing the enzyme, 
respectively. Averages of the results obtained in independent three experiments are shown with standard errors. The 
results were analyzed by the Student's T-test. The symbol "*" in Fig. 4 represents significance with p &lt; 0.05. 
[0101] As a result, it was found that the binding amount of IgM was smaller in the kidney treated with the enzyme than 
that in the kidney treated with a solution not containing the enzyme. In the swine kidneys that were not treated with the 
enzyme, 31% of IgM binding activity remained in the human plasma on average (Fig. 4). On the other hand, in the 
kidneys treated with the enzyme, 64% of the activity remained on average (Fig. 4). This difference was statistically 
significant. These results indicate that a large amount of IgM-binding antigen epitopes were removed by the endo-β-
galactosidase C digestion. 
[0102] However, the binding abilities of IgG and IgA were not decreased so much by the enzymatic treatment, and 
did not show a statistically significant difference, either (Fig. 4). 

Industrial Applicability 

[0103] By using the DNA of the present invention, endo-β-galactosidase C can be prepared by a genetic engineering 
technique at a low cost and in a large amount. 
[0104] Moreover, the recombinant vector of the present invention prepared by using the DNA of the present invention, 
the transformant of the present invention prepared by using the recombinant vector of the present invention and the 
production method of the present invention utilizing the transformant of the present invention are useful for extensive 
preparation of endo-β-galactosidase C. 
[0105] Furthermore, if the regent for treatment of the present invention is used to preliminarily remove α-galactose 
antigens expressed in, for example, organs of swine or the like and this organ is used for transplantation into human, 
ape or the like (not expressing the α-galactose antigens), hyperacute rejection in the case of xenotransplantation can 
be suppressed, and therefore it is extremely useful. It is particularly useful for treatment of such a kidney for transplantation. 
[0106] The organ of the present invention obtained by treating an organ with the regent for treatment of the present 
invention is extremely useful as an organ for xenotransplantation.

Description 

Field of the Invention 

[0001] The present invention relates to compositions and methods for the diagnosis and treatment of tumor. 

Background of the Invention 

[0002] Malignant tumors (cancers) are the second leading cause of death in the United States, after heart disease 
(Boring et al., CA Cancel J. Clin., 43:7[1993]). 
[0003] Cancer is characterized by an increase in the number of abnormal, or neoplastic cells derived from a normal 
tissue which proliferate to form a tumor mass, the invasion of adjacent tissues by these neoplastic tumor cells, and the 
generation of malignant cells which eventually spread via the blood or lymphatic system to regional lymph nodes and 
to distant sites (metastasis). In a cancerous state, a cell proliferates under conditions in which normal cells would not 
grow. Cancer manifests itself in a wide variety of forms, characterized by different degrees of invasiveness and aggres-
siveness. 
[0004] Alteration of gene expression is intimately related to the uncontrolled cell growth and de-differentiation which 
are a common feature of all cancers. The genomes of certain well studied tumors have been found to show decreased 
expression of recessive genes, usually referred to as tumor suppression genes, which would normally function to prevent 
malignant cell growth, and/or overexpression of certain dominant genes, such as oncogenes, that act to promote ma-
lignant growth. Each of these genetic changes appears to be responsible for importing some of the traits that, in aggregate, 
represent the full neoplastic phenotype (Hunter, Cell, 64:1129 [1991] and Bishop, Cell, 64:235-248 [1991]): 
[0005] A well known mechanism of gene (e.g., oncogene) overexpression in cancer cells is gene amplification. This 
is a process where in the chromosome of the ancestral cell multiple copies of a particular gene are produced. The 
process involves unscheduled replication of the region of chromosome comprising the gene, followed by recombination 
of the replicated segments back into the chromosome (Alitalo et al., Adv. Cancer Res., 47:235-281 [1986]). It is believed 
that the overexpression of the gene parallels gene amplification, Le., is proportionate to the number of copies made. 
[0006] Proto-oncogenes that encode growth factors and growth factor receptors have been identified to play important 
roles in the pathogenesis of various human malignancies, including breast cancer. For example, it has been found that 
the human ErbB2 gene (erbB2, also known as her2, or c-erbB-2), which encodes a 185-kd transmembrane glycoprotein 
receptor (p 185 HER2 ; HER2) related to the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR). is overexpressed in about 25% to 
30% of human breast cancer (Slamon et al., Science, 235:177-182 [1987]; Slamon et al., Science, 244:707-712 [1989]). 
[0007] It has been reported that gene amplification of a proto-oneogene is an event typically involved in the more 
malignant forms of cancer, and could act as a predictor of clinical outcome (Schwab et al., Genes Chromosomes Cancer, 
1:181-193 [1990]; Alitalo et al., supra). Thus, erbB2 overexpression is commonty regarded as a predictor of a poor 
prognosis, especially in patients with primary disease that involves axillary lymph nodes (Slamon et al., [1987] and 
[1989], supra; Ravdin and Chamness, Gene, 159:19-27 [1995]; and Hynes and Stern, Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1198: 
165-184 [1994]). and has been linked to sensitivity and/or resistance to hormone therapy and chemotherapeutic regimens, 
including CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluoruracil) and anthracyclines (Baselga et al., Oncology, 11 (3 
Suppll):43-48 [1997]). However, despite the association of erbB2 overexpression with poor prognosis, the odds of HER2-
positive patients responding clinically to treatment with taxanes were greater than three times those of HER2-negative 
patients (Ibid) A recombinant humanized anti-ErbB2 (anti-HER2) monoclonal antibody (a humanized version of the 
murine anti-ErbB2 antibody 4D5, referred to as rbuMAb HER2 or Herceptin ™ ) has been clinically active in patients with 
ErbB2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancers that had received extensive prior anticancer therapy. (Baselga et al., 
J. Clin, Oncol., 14:737-744 [1996]). 
[0008] In light of the above, there is obvious interest in identifying novel methods and compositions which arc useful 
for diagnosing and treating tumors which are associated with gene amplification. 

Summary of the Invention 

A. Embodiments 

[0009] The present invention concerns compositions and methods for the diagnosis and treatment of neoplastic cell 
growth and proliferation in mammals, including humans. The present invention is based on the identification of genes 
that are amplified in the genome of tumor cells Such gene amplification is expected to be associated with the overex-
pression of the gene product and contribute to tumorigenesis. Accordingly, the proteins encoded by the amplified genes 
are believed to be useful targets for the diagnosis and/or treatment (including prevention) of certain cancers, and may 
act as predictors of the prognosis of tumor treatment.

[0010] In one embodiment, the present invention concerns an isotated antibody which binds to a polypeptide designated 
herein as a PRO7133 polypeptide. In one aspect, the isolated antibody specifically binds to a PRO7133 polypeptide. 
Often, a cell that expresses the PRO7133 polypeptide is a tumor cell that overexpresses the polypeptide as compared 
to a normal cell of the same tissue type. In yet another aspect, the antibody is a monoclonal antibody, which preferably 
has non-human complementarity determining region (CDR) residues and human framework region (FR) residues. The 
antibody may be labeled and may be immobilized on a solid support In yet another aspect, the antibody is an antibody 
fragment, a single-chain antibody, or a humanized antibody which binds, preferably specifically, to a PRO7133 polypep-
tide. 
[0011] In another embodiment, the invention concerns a composition of matter which comprises an antibody which 
binds, preferably specifically, to a PRO7133 polypeptide in admixture with a carrier. Preferably, the composition is sterile. 
[0012] In a further embodiment, the invention concerns isolated nucleic acid molecules which encode anti-PRO7133 
antibodies, and vectors and recombinant host cells comprising such nucleic acid molecules. 
[0013] In a still further embodiment, the invention concerns a method for producing an anti-PRO7133 antibody, wherein 
the method comprises culturing a host cell transformed with a nucleic acid molecule which encodes the antibody under 
conditions sufficient to allow expression of the antibody, and recovering the antibody from, the cell culture. 
[0014] The invention may enable the production of PRO7133 polypeptide that inhibit one or more of the biological 
and/or immunological functions or activities of a PRO7133 polypeptide. 
[0015] In a further embodiment, the invention concerns an isolated nucleic acid molecule that hybridizes to a nucleic 
acid molecule encoding a PRO7133 polypeptide or the complement thereof. The isolated nucleic acid molecule is 
preferably DNA, and hybridization preferably occurs under stringent hybridization and wash conditions. Such nucleic 
acid molecules can act as antisense molecules of the amplified genes identified herein, which, in turn, can find use in 
the modulation of the transcription and/or translation of the respective amplified genes, or as antisense primers in 
amplification reactions. Furthermore, such sequences can be used as part of a ribozyme and/or a triple helix sequence 
which, in turn, may be used in regulation of the amplified genes. 
[0016] In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for determining the presence of a PRO7133 polypep-
tide in a sample suspected of containing a PRO7133 polypeptide, wherein the method comprises exposing the sample 
to an anti-PRO7133 antibody and determining binding of the antibody to a PRO7133 polypeptide in the sample. In 
another embodiment, the invention provides a method for determining the presence of a PRO7133 polypeptide in a cell, 
wherein the method comprises exposing the cell to an anti-PRO7133 antibody and determining binding of the antibody 
to the cell. 
[0017] In yet another embodiment, the present invention concerns a method of diagnosing tumor in a mammal. 
comprising detecting the level of expression of a gene encoding a PRO7133 polypeptide (a) in a test sample of tissue 
cells obtained from the mammal, and (b) in a control sample of known normal tissue cells of the same cell type, wherein 
a higher expression level in the test sample as compared to the control sample, is indicative of the presence of tumor 
in the mammal from which the test tissue cells were obtained. 
[0018] In another embodiment, the present invention concerns a method of diagnosing tumor in a mammal, comprising 
(a) contacting an anti-PRO7133 antibody with a test sample of tissue cells obtained from the mammal, and (b) detecting 
the formation of a complex between the anti-PRO7133 antibody and a PRO713 polypeptide in the test sample, wherein 
the formation of a complex is indicative of the presence of a tumor in said mammal. The detection may be qualitative 
or quantitative, and may be performed in comparison with monitoring the complex formation in a control sample of known 
normal tissue cells of the same cell type. A larger quantity of complexes formed in the test sample indicates the presence 
of tumor in the mammal from which the test tissue cells were obtained. The antibody preferably carries a detectable 
label. Complex formation can be monitored, for example, by tight microscopy, flow cytometry, fluorimetry, or other 
techniques known in the art. 
[0019] The test sample is usually obtained from an individual suspected to have neoplastic cell growth or proliferation 
(e.g. cancerous cells). 
[0020] In another embodiment, the present invention concerns a cancer diagnostic kit comprising an anti-PRO7133 
anti-PRO7133 antibody and a carrier (e.g., a buffer) in suitable packaging. The kit preferably contains instructions for 
using the antibody to detect the presence of a PRO7133 polypeptide in a sample suspected of containing the same.

Detailed Description of the invention 

I. Definitions 

[0038] The phrases "gene amplification" and "gene duplication" are used interchangeably and refer to a process by 
which multiple copies of a gene or gene fragment are formed in a particular cell or cell line. The duplicated region (a 
stretch of amplified DNA) is often referred to as "amplicon." Usually, the amount of the messenger RNA (mRNA) produced, 
i.e., the level of gene expression, also increases in the proportion of the number of copies made of the particular gene 
expressed. 
[0039] "Tumor", as used herein, refers to all neoplastic cell growth and proliferation, whether malignant or benign, 
and all pre-cancerous and cancerous cells and tissues. 
[0040] The terms "cancer" and "cancerous" refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically 
characterized by unregulated cell growth. Examples of cancer include but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, 
blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia. More particular examples of such cancers include breast cancer, prostate cancer, 
colon cancer, squamous cell cancer, small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic 
cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, colorectal cancer, en-
dometrial carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney cancer, liver cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic car-
cinoma and various types of bead and neck cancer. 
[0041] "Treatment" is an intervention performed with the intention of preventing the development or altering the pa-
thology of a disorder. Accordingly, "treatment" refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative 
measures. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder as well as those in which the disorder is 
to be prevented. In tumor (e.g., cancer) treatment, a therapeutic agent may directly decrease the pathology of tumor 
cells, or render the tumor cells more susceptible to treatment by other therapeutic agents, e.g., radiation and/or chem-


EP 1 623 990 B1

otherapy. 
[0042] The "pathology" of cancer includes all phenomena that compromise the well-being of the patient. This includes, 
without limitation, abnormal or uncontrollable ceU growth, metastasis, interference with the normal functioning of neigh-
boring cells, release of cytokines or other secretory products at abnormal levels, suppression or aggravation of inflam-
matory or immunological response, etc. 
[0043] "Mammal" for purposes of treatment refers to any animal classified as a mammal, including humans, domestic 
and farm animals, and zoo, sports, or pet animals, such as dogs, horses, cats, cattle, pigs, sheep, etc. Preferably, the 
mammal is human. 
[0044] "Carriers" as used herein include pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers which are 
nontoxic to the cell or mammal being exposed thereto at the dosages and concentrations employed. Often the physio-
logically acceptable carrier is an aqueous pH buffered solution. Examples of physiologically acceptable carriers include 
buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low molecular weight 
(less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin. gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic 
polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine; mon-
osaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such 
as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counterions such as sodium; and/or nonionic sur-
factants such as TWEEN ™ , polyethylene glycol (PEG), and PLURONICS ™ . 
[0045] Administration "in combination with" one or more further therapeutic agents includes simultaneous (concurrent) 
and consecutive administration in any order. 
[0046] The term "cytotoxic agent" as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells 
and/or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes (e.g., I 131 , I 125 , Y 90 and Re 186 ), 
chemotherapeutic agents, and toxins such as enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, or 
fragments thereof. 
[0047] A "chemotherapeutic agent" is a chemical compound useful in the treatment of cancer. Examples of chemo-
therapeutic agents include adriamycin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, 5-fluorouracil, cytosine arabinoside ("Ara-C"), cyclophos-
phamide, thiotepa, busulfan, cytoxin, taxoids. e.g., paclitaxel (Taxol. Bristol-Myers Squibb Oncology, Princeton. NJ), 
and doxetaxel (Taxotere, Rhône-Poulenc Rorer, Antony, Rnace), toxotere, methotrexate, cisplatin, melphalan, vinblas-
tine, bleomycin, etoposide, ifosfamide, mitomycin C. mitoxantrone, vincristine, vinorelbine, carboplatin, teniposide, dau-
nomycin, carminomycin, aminopterin, actinomycin, mitomycins, esperamicins (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,675.187). 5-FU, 6-
thioguanine, 6-mercaptopurine, actinomycin D, VP-16. chlorambucil, melphalan, and other related nitrogen mustards. 
Also included in this definition are hormonal agents that act to regulate or inhibit hormone action on tumors such as 
tamoxifen and onapristone. 
[0048] A "growth inhibitory agent" when used herein refers to a compound or composition which inhibits growth of a 
cell, especially cancer cell overexpressing any of the genes identified herein, either in vitro or in vivo. Thus, the growth 
inhibitory agent is one which significantly reduces the percentage of cells overexpressing such genes in S phase. 
Examples of growth inhibitory agents include agents that block cell cycle progression (at a place other than S phase), 
such as agents that induce G1 arrest and M-phase arrest. Classical M-phase blockers include the vincas (vincristine 
and vinblastine), taxol, and topo II inhibitors such as doxorubicin, epirubicin, daunorubicin, etoposide, and bleomycin. 
Those agents that arrest G1 also spill over into S-phase arrest, for example, DNA alkylating agents such as tamoxifen, 
prednisone, dacarbazine, mechlorethamine, cisplatin, methotrexate. 5-fluorouracil, and ara-C. Further information can 
be found in The Molecular Basis of Cancer, Mendelsohn and Israel, eds., Chapter 1, entitled "Cell cycle regulation, 
oncogens, and antineoplastic drugs' by Murakami et al., (WB Saunders: Philadelphia, 1995), especially p. 13. 
[0049] "Doxorubicin" is an anthracycline antibiotic. The full chemical name of doxorubicin is (8S-cis)-10-[(3-amino-
2,3,6-trideoxy-α-L-lyxo-hexapyranosyl)oxy]-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-6,8,11-tribydroxy-8-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-methoxy-5,12-
naphthacenedione. 
[0050] The term "cytokine" is a generic term for proteins released by one cell population which act on another cell as 
intercellular mediators. Examples of such cytokines are lymphokines, monokines, and traditional polypeptide hormones. 
Included among the cytokines are growth hormone such as human growth hormone, N-methionyl human growth hormone, 
and bovine growth hormone; parathyroid hormone; thyroxine; insulin; proinsulin; relaxin; prorelaxin; glycoprotein hor-
mones such as follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH); 
hepatic growth factor; fibroblast growth factor: prolactin; placental lactogen: tumor necrosis factor-a and -β; mullerian-
inhibiting substance; mouse gonadotropin-associated peptide; inhibin; activin; vascular endothelial growth factor; in-
tegrin; thrombopoietin (TPO); nerve growth factors such as NGF-β; platelet-growth factor; transforming growth factors 
(TGFs) such as TGF-α and TGF-β; insulin-like growth factor-I and -II; erythropoietin (EPO); osteoinductive factors; 
interferons such as interferon -α, -β, and -γ; colony stimulating factors (CSFs) such as macrophage-CSF(M-CSF): 
granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF); and granulocyte-CSF(G-CSF); interleukins (ILs) such as IL-1, IL-1a, IL-2, 
IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-11, IL-12; a tumor necrosis factor such as TNF-α or TNF-β; and other polypeptide 
factors including LIF and kit ligand (KL). As used herein, the term cytokine includes proteins from natural sources or 


EP 1 623 990 B1

from recombinant cell culture and biologically active equivalents of the native sequence cytokines. 
[0051] The term "prodrug" as used in this application refers to a precursor or derivative form of a pharmaceutically 
active substance that is less cytotoxic to tumor cells compared to the parent drug and is capable of being enzymatically 
activated or converted into the more active parent form. See, e.g., Wilman, "Prodrugs in Cancer Chemotherapy", Bio-
chemical Society Transactions, 14:375-382, 615th Meeting, Belfast(1986), and Stella et al., "Prodrugs: A Chemical 
Approach to Targeted Drug Delivery", Directed Drug Delivery, Borchardt et al., (ed.), pp. 147-267, Humana Press (1985). 
The prodrugs of this invention include, but are not limited to, phosphate-containing prodrugs, thiophosphate-containing 
prodrugs, sulfate-containing prodrugs, peptide-containing prodrugs, D-amino acid-modified prodrugs, glysocylated pro-
drugs, β-lactam-containing prodrugs, optionally substituted phenoxyacetamide-containing prodrugs or optionally sub-
stituted phenylacetamide-containing prodrugs. 5-fluorocytosine and other 5-fluorouridine prodrugs which can be con-
verted into the more active cytotoxic free drug. Examples of cytotoxic drugs that can be derivatized into a prodrugs form 
for use in this invention include, but are not limited to, those chemotherapeutic agents described above. 
[0052] An "effective amount" of a polypeptide disclosed herein or an antagonist thereof, in reference to inhibition of 
neoplastic cell growth, tumor growth or cancer cell growth, is an amount capable of inhibiting, to some extent, the growth 
of target cells. The term includes an amount capable of invoking a growth inhibitory, cytostatic and/or cytotoxic effect 
and/or apoptosis of the target cells. An "effective amount" of a PRO polypeptide antagonist for purposes of inhibiting 
neoplastic cell growth, tumor growth or cancer cell growth, may be determined empirically and in a routine manner. 
[0053] A "therapeutically effective amount", in reference to the treatment of tumor, refers to an amount capable of 
invoking one or more of the following effects: (I) inhibition, to some extent, of tumor growth, including, slowing down and 
complete growth arrest; (2) reduction in the number of tumor cells: (3) reduction in tumor size; (4) inhibition (i.e., reduction, 
slowing down or complete stopping) of tumor cell infiltration into peripheral organs: (5) inhibition (i.e., reduction, slowing 
down or complete stopping) of metastasis: (6) enhancement of anti-tumor immune response, which may, but does not 
have to, result in the regression or rejection of the tumor: and/or (7) relief, to some extent, of one or more symptoms 
associated with the disorder. A "therapeutically effective amount" of a PRO polypeptide antagonist for purposes of 
treatment of tumor may be determined empirically and in a routine manner. 
[0054] A "growth inhibitory amount" of a PRO antagonist is an amount capable of inhibiting the growth of a cell, 
especially tumor, e.g., cancer cell, either in vitro or in vivo. A "growth inhibitory amount" of a PRO antagonist for purposes 
of inhibiting neoplastic cell growth may be determined empirically and in a routine manner. 
[0055] A "cytotoxic amount" of a PRO antagonist is an amount capable of causing the destruction of a cell, especially 
tumor, e.g., cancer cell, either in vitro or in vivo. A "cytotoxic amount" of a PRO antagonist for purposes of inhibiting 
neoplastic cell growth may be determined empirically and in a routine manner. 
[0056] The terms "PRO polypeptide" and "PRO" as used herein and when immediately followed by a numerical 
designation refer to various polypeptides, wherein the complete designation (i.e., PRO/number) refers to specific polypep-
tide sequences as described herein. The terms "PRO/number polypeptide" and "PRO/number" wherein the term "number" 
is provided as an actual numerical designation as used herein encompass native sequence polypeptides and polypeptide 
variants (which are further defined herein). The PRO polypeptides described herein may be isolated from a variety of 
sources, such as from human tissue types or from another source, or prepared by recombinant or synthetic methods. 
[0057] A "native sequence PRO polypeptide" comprises a polypeptide having the same amino acid sequence as the 
corresponding PRO polypeptide derived from nature. Such native sequence PRO polypeptides can be isolated from 
nature or can be produced by recombinant or synthetic means. The term "native sequence PRO polypeptide" specifically 
encompasses naturally-occurring truncated or secreted forms of the specific PRO polypeptide (e.g., an extracellular 
domain sequence), naturally-occurring variant forms (e.g., alternatively spliced forms) and naturally-occurring allelic 
variants of the polypeptide. In various embodiments of the invention, the native sequence PRO polypeptides disclosed 
herein are mature or full-length native sequence polypeptides comprising the full-length amino acids sequences shown 
in the accompanying figures. Start and stop codons are shown in bold font and underlined in the figures. However, while 
the PRO polypeptide disclosed in the accompanying figures are shown to begin with methionine residues designated 
herein as amino acid position 1 in the figures, it is conceivable and possible that other methionine residues located either 
upstream or downstream from the amino acid position 1 in the figures may be employed as the starting amino acid 
residue for the PRO polypeptides. 
[0058] The PRO polypeptide "extracellular domain" or "ECD" refers to a form of the PRO polypeptide which is essentially 
free of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Ordinarily, a PRO polypeptide ECD will have leas than 1% of such 
transmembrane and/or cytoplasmic domains and preferably, will have less than 0.5% of such domains. It will be under-
stood that any transmembrane domains identified for the PRO polypeptides of the present invention are identified 
pursuant to criteria routinely employed in the art for identifying that type of hydrophobic domain. The exact boundaries 
of a transmembrane domain may vary but most likely by no more than about 5 amino acids at either end of the domain 
as initially identified herein. Optionally, therefore, an extracellular domain of a PRO polypeptide may contain from about 
5 or fewer amino acids on either side of the transmembrane domain/extracellular domain boundary as identified in the 
Examples or specification and such polypeptides, with or without the associated signal peptide, and nucleic acid encoding

them, are contemplated by the present invention. 
[0059] The approximate location of the "signal peptides" of the various PRO polypeptides disclosed herein are shown 
in the present specification and/or the accompanying figures. It is noted, however, that the C-terminal boundary of a 
signal peptide may vary, but most likely by no more than about 5 amino acids on either side of the signal peptide C-
terminal boundary as initially identified herein, wherein the C-tenninal boundary of the signal peptide may be identified 
pursuant to criteria routinely employed in the art for identifying that type of amino acid sequence element (e.g., Nielsen 
et al., Prot. Eng., 10:1-6 (1997) and von Heinje et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 14:4683-4690 (1986)). Moreover, it is also 
recognized that, in some cases, cleavage of a signal sequence from a secreted polypeptide is not entirely, uniform, 
resulting in more than one secreted species. These mature polypeptides, where the signal peptide is cleaved within no 
more than about 5 amino acids on either side of the C-terminal boundary of the signal peptide as identified herein, and 
the polynucleotides encoding them, are contemplated by the present invention. 
[0060] "PRO polypeptide variant" means an active PRO polypeptide as defined above or below having at least about 
80% amino acid sequence identity with a full-length native sequence PRO polypeptide sequence as disclosed herein, 
a PRO polypeptide sequence lacking the signal peptide as disclosed herein, an extracellular domain of a PRO polypeptide, 
with or without the signal peptide, as disclosed herein or any other fragment of a full-length PRO polypeptide sequence 
as disclosed herein. Such PRO polypeptide variants include, for instance, PRO polypeptides wherein one or more amino 
acid residues are added, or deleted, at the N-or C-terminus of the full-length native amino acid sequence. Ordinarily, 
a PRO polypeptide variant will have at least about 80% amino acid sequence identity, preferably at least about 81% 
amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 82% amino add sequence identity, more preferably at least 
about 83% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 84% amino acid sequence identity, more 
preferably at least about 85% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 86% amino acid sequence 
identity, more preferably at least about 87% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 88% amino 
acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 89% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 
90% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 91% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably 
at least about 92% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 93% amino acid sequence identity, 
more preferably at least about 94% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 95% amino acid 
sequence identity, more preferably at least about 96% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 
97% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 98% amino acid sequence identity and most preferably 
at least about 99% amino acid sequence identity with a full-length native sequence PRO polypeptide sequence as 
disclosed herein, a PRO polypeptide sequence lacking the signal peptide as disclosed herein, an extracellular domain 
of a PRO polypeptide, with or without the signal peptide, as disclosed herein or any other specifically defined fragment 
of a full-length PRO polypeptide sequence as disclosed herein. Ordinarily, PRO variant polypeptides are at least about 
10 amino acids in length, often at least about 20 amino acids in length, more often at least about 30 amino acids in 
length, more often at least about 40 amino acids in length, more often at least about 50 amino acids in length, more 
often at least about 60 amino acids in length, more often at least about 70 amino acids in length, more often at least 
about 80 amino acids in length, more often at least about 90 amino acids in length, more often at least about 100 amino 
acids in length, more often at least about 150 amino acids in length, more often at least about 200 amino acids in length, 
more often at least about 300 amino acids in length, or more. 
[0061] As shown below, Table 1 provides the complete source code for the ALIGN-2 sequence comparison computer 
program. This source code may be routinely compiled for use on a UNIX operating system to provide the ALIGN-2 
sequence comparison computer program. 
[0062] In addition, Tables 2A-2D show hypothetical exemplifications for using the below described method to determine 
% amino acid sequence identity (Tables 2A-2B) and % nucleic acid sequence identity (Tables 2C-2D) using the ALIGN-
2 sequence comparison computer program, wherein "PRO" represents the amino acid sequence of a hypothetical PRO 
polypeptide of interest. "Comparison Protein" represents the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide against which the 
"PRO" polypeptide of interest is being compared. "PRO-DNA" represents a hypothetical PRO-encoding nucleic acid 
sequence of interest. "Comparison DNA" represents the nucleotide sequence of a nucleic acid molecule against which 
the "PRO-DNA" nucleic acid molecule of interest is being compared, "X", "Y", and "Z" each represent different hypothetical 
amino acid residues and "N". "L" and "V" each represent different hypothetical nucleotides.

[0063] "Percent (%) amino acid sequence identity" with respect to the PRO polypeptide sequences identified herein 
is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid 
residues in a PRO sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum 
percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment 
for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the 
skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN, ALIGN-2 or 
Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, 
including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full-length of the sequences being compared. 
For purposes herein, however, % amino acid sequence identity values are obtained as described below by using the 
sequence comparison computer program ALIGN-2, wherein the complete source code for the ALIGN-2 program is 
provided in Table 1. The ALIGN-2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech, Inc., and the 
source code shown in Table 1 has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office, Washington D.C., 
20559, where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN-2 program is publicly 
available through Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, California or may be compiled from the source code provided 
in Table 1. The ALIGN-2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system, preferably digital UNIX 
V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN-2 program and do not vary. 
[0064] For purposes herein, the % amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against 
a given amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or 
comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is calculated 
as follows: 

where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN-
2 in that program's alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated 
that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B, the % amino acid 
sequence identity of A to B will not equal the % amino acid sequence identity of B to A. As examples of % amino acid 
sequence identity calculations, Tables 2A-2B demonstrate how to calculate the % amino acid sequence identity of the 
amino acid sequence designated "Comparison Protein" to the amino acid sequence designated "PRO". 
[0065] Unless specifically stated otherwise, all % amino acid sequence identity values used herein are obtained as 
described above using the AUGN-2 sequence comparison computer program. However, % amino acid sequence identity 
may also be determined using the sequence comparison program NCBI-BLAST2 (Altschul et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 
25:3389-3402 (1997)). The NCBI-BLAST2 sequence comparison program may be downloaded from http://www.ncbi.nlt-
mrt,ih.gov. NCBI-BLAST2 uses several search parameters, wherein all of those search parameters are set to default 
values including, for example, unmask = yes, strand = all, expected occurrences = 10. minimum low complexity length 
= 15/5, multi-pass e-value = 0.01, constant for multi-pass = 25, dropoff for final gapped alignment = 25 and scoring

[0066] In situations where NCBI-BLAST2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons, the % amino acid 
sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B (which can 
alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain % amino acid sequence 
identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is calculated as follows: 

where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program NCBI-
BLAST2 in that program's alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be 
appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B, the 
% amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the % amino acid sequence identity of B to A. 
[0067] In addition, % amino acid sequence identity may also be determined using the WU-BLAST-2 computer program 
(Altschul et al., Methods in Enzymology, 266:460-480 (1996)). Most of the WU-BLAST-2 search parameters are set to 
the default values. Those not set to default values, i.e., the adjustable parameters, are set with the following values: 
overlap span = 1. overlap fraction = 0.125, word threshold (T) = 11, and scoring matrix = BLOSUM62. For purposes 
herein, a % amino acid sequence identity value is determined by dividing (a) the number of matching identical amino 
acids residues between the amino acid sequence of the PRO polypeptide of interest having a sequence derived from 
the native PRO polypeptide and the comparison amino acid sequence of interest (i.e., the sequence against which the 
PRO polypeptide of interest is being compared which may be a PRO variant polypeptide) as determined by WU-BLAST-
2 by (b) the total number of amino acid residues of the PRO polypeptide of interest. For example, in the statement "a 
polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence A which has or having at least 80% amino acid sequence identity to 
the amino acid sequence B", the amino acid sequence A is the comparison amino acid sequence of interest and the 
amino acid sequence B is the amino acid sequence of the PRO polypeptide of interest. 
[0068] "PRO variant polypeptide" or "PRO variant nucleic acid sequence" means a nucleic acid molecule which 
encodes an active PRO polypeptide as defined below and which has at least about 80% nucleic acid sequence identity 
with a nucleotide acid sequence encoding a full-length native sequence PRO polypeptide sequence as disclosed herein, 
a full-length native sequence PRO polypeptide sequence lacking the signal peptide as disclosed herein, an extracellular 
domain of a PRO polypeptide, with or without the signal peptide, as disclosed herein or any other fragment of a full-
leogth PRO polypeptide sequence as disclosed herein. Ordinarily, a PRO variant polynucleotide will have at least about 
80% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 81% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably 
at least about 82% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 83% nucleic acid sequence identity,

sequence identity, more preferably at least about 86% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 
87% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 88% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably

more preferably at least about 91% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 92% nucleic acid 
sequence identity, more preferably at least about 93% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 
94% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 95% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably

more preferably at least about 98% nucleic acid sequence identity and yet more preferably at least about 99% nucleic 
acid sequence identity with the nucleic acid sequence encoding a full-length native sequence PRO polypeptide sequence 
as disclosed herein, a full-length native sequence PRO polypeptide sequence lacking the signal peptide as disclosed 
herein, an extracellular domain of a PRO polypeptide, with or without the signal sequence, as disclosed herein or any 
other fragment of a full-length PRO polypeptide sequence as disclosed herein. Variants do not encompass the native 
nucleotide sequence. 
[0069] Ordinarily, PRO variant polynucleotides are at least about 30 nucleotides in length, often at least about 60 
nucleotides in length, more often at least about 90 nucleotides in length, more often at least about 120 nucleotides in 
length, more often at least about 150 nucleotides in length, more often at least about 180 nucleotides in length, more 
often at least about 210 nucleotides in length, more often at least about 240 nucleotides in length, more often at least

nucleotides in length, more often at least about 600 nucleotides in length, more often at least about 900 nucleotides in 
length, or more. 
[0070] "Percent (%) nucleic acid sequence identity" with respect to the PRO polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid se-
quences identified herein is defined as the percentage of nucleotides in a candidate sequence that are identical with 
the nucleotides in a PRO polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing

5 





















gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent 
nucleic acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using 
publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2. ALIGN. ALIGN-2 or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. 
Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed 
to achieve maximal alignment over the full-length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein, however, % 
nucleic acid sequence identity values are obtained as described below by using the sequence comparison computer 
program AUGN-2, wherein the complete source code for the ALIGN-2 program is provided in Table 1. The AUGN-2 
sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech, Inc., and the source code shown in Table 1 has 
been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office, Washington D.C., 20559, where it is registered under 
U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN-2 program is publicly available through Genentech. Inc., South 
San Francisco. California or may be compiled from the source code provided in Table 1. The AUGN-2 program should 
be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system, preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters 
are set by the AUGN-2 program and do not vary. 
[0071] For purposes herein, the % nucleic acid sequence identity of a given nucleic acid sequence C to, with, or 
against a given nucleic acid sequence D (which can alternatively be phrased as a given nucleic acid sequence C that 
has or comprises a certain % nucleic acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given nucleic acid sequence D) is 
calculated as follows: 

where W is the number of nucleotides scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN-2 in that 
program's alignment of C and D, and where Z is the total number of nucleotides in D. It will be appreciated that where 
the length of nucleic acid sequence C is not equal to the length of nucleic acid sequence D, the % nucleic acid sequence 
identity of C to D will not equal the % nucleic acid sequence identity of D to C. As examples of % nucleic acid sequence 
identity calculations, Tables 2C-2D demonstrate how to calculate the % nucleic acid sequence identity of the nucleic 
acid sequence designated "Comparison DNA" to the nucleic acid sequence designated "PRO-DNA". 
[0072] Unless specifically stated otherwise, all % nucleic acid sequence identity values used herein are obtained as 
described above using the ALIGN-2 sequence comparison computer program. However, % nucleic acid sequence 
identity may also be determined using the sequence comparison program NCBI-BLAST2 (Altschul et al., Nucleic Acids 
Res., 25:3389-3402 (1997)). The NCBI-BLAST2 sequence comparison program may be downloaded from http://www.nc-
bi.nlm.nih.gov. NCBI-BLAST2 uses several search parameters, wherein all of those search parameters are set to default 
values including, for example, unmask = yes, strand = all, expected occurrences =10, minimum low complexity length 
= 15/5, multi-pass e-value =0.01, constant for multi-pass =25. dropoff for final gapped alignment = 25 and scoring matrix 
= BLOSUM62. 
[0073] In situations where NCBI-BLAST2 is employed for sequence comparisons, the % nucleic acid sequence identity 
of a given nucleic acid sequence C to, with, or against a given nucleic acid sequence D (which can alternatively be 
phrased as a given nucleic acid sequence C that has or comprises a certain % nucleic acid sequence identity to, with, 
or against a given nucleic acid sequence D) is calculated as follows: 

where W is the number of nucleotides scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program NCBI-BLAST2 
in that program's alignment of C and D, and where Z is the total number of nucleotides in D. It will be appreciated that 
where the length of nucleic acid sequence C is not equal to the length of nucleic acid sequence D, the % nucleic acid 
sequence identity of C to D will not equal the % nucleic acid sequence identity of D to C. 
[0074] In addition, % nucleic acid sequence identity values may also be generated using the WU-BLAST-2 computer 
program (Altschul et al., Methods in Enzymololgy, 266:460-480 (1996)). Most of the WU-BLAST-2 search parameters 
are set to the default values. Those not set to default values, i.e., the adjustable parameters, are set with the following 
values: overlap span = 1, overlap fraction = 0.125, word threshold (T) = 11, and scoring matrix = BLOSUM62. For 
purposes herein, a % nucleic acid sequence identity value is determined by dividing (a) the number of matching identical 
nucleotides between the nucleic acid sequence of the PRO polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecule of interest 
having a sequence derived from the native sequence PRO polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid and the comparison nucleic 
acid molecule of interest (i.e., the sequence against which the PRO potypeptide-eneoding nucleic acid molecule of 
interest is being compared which may be a variant PRO polynucleotide) as determined by WU-BLAST-2 by (b) the total 


EP 1 623 990 B1 

31 

5 





















number of nucleotides of the PRO polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecule of interest. For example, in the statement 
"an isolated nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleic acid sequence A which has or having at least 80% nucleic acid 
sequence identity to the nucleic acid sequence B", the nucleic acid sequence A is the comparison nucleic acid molecule 
of interest and the nucleic acid sequence B is the nucleic acid sequence of the PRO polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid 
molecule of interest. 
[0075] In other embodiments, PRO variant polynucleotides are nucleic acid molecules that encode an active PRO 
polypeptide and which are capable of hybridizing, preferably under stringent hybridization and wash conditions, to 
nucleotide sequences encoding the full-length PRO polypeptide shown in Figure 2 (SEQ ID NO:2) PRO variant polypep-
tides may be those that are encoded by a PRO variant polynucleotide. 
[0076] The term "positives", in the context of the amino acid sequence identity comparisons performed as described 
above, includes amino acid residues in the sequences compared that are not only identical, but also those that have 
similar properties. Amino acid residues that score a positive value to an amino acid residue of interest are those that 
are either identical to the amino acid residue of interest or are a preferred substitution (as defined in Table 3 below) of 
the amino acid residue of interest. 
[0077] For purposes herein, the % value of positives of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given 
amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises 
a certain % positives to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is calculated as follows: 

where X is the number of amino acid residues scoring a positive value as defined above by the sequence alignment 
program ALIGN-2 in that program's alignment of A and B. and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. 
It wilt be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence 
B. the % positives of A to B will not equal the % positives of B to A. 
[0078] "Isolated," when used to describe the various polypeptides disclosed herein, means polypeptide that has been 
identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Preferably, the isolated polypep-
tide is free of association with all components with which it is naturally associated. Contaminant components of its natural 
environment are materials that would typically interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the polypeptide, and may 
include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the 
polypeptide will be purified (1) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid 
sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (2) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing or reducing 
conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated polypeptide includes polypeptide in situ within 
recombinant cells, since at least one component of the PRO natural environment will not be present Ordinarily, however, 
isolated polypeptide will be prepared by at least one purification step. 
[0079] An "isolated" nucleic acid molecule encoding a PRO polypeptide or an "isolated" nucleic acid encoding an anti-
PRO antibody, is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid 
molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the natural source of the PRO-encoding nucleic acid or the anti-PRO-
encoding nucleic acid. Preferably, the isolated nucleic acid is free of association with all components with which it is 
naturally associated. An isolated PRO-encoding nucleic acid molecule or an anti-PRO-encoding nucleic acid molecule 
is other than In the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished 
from the PRO-encoding nucleic acid molecule or the anti-PRO-encoding nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural 
celts. However, an isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding a PRO polypeptide or an anti-PRO antibody includes PRO-
nucleic acid molecules and anti-PRO-nucleic acid molecules contained in cells that ordinarily express PRO polypeptides 
or express anti-PRO antibodies where, for example, the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal location different 
from that of natural cells. 
[0080] The term "control sequences" refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked 
coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes, for example, 
include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize 
promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers. 
[0081] Nucleic acid is "operably linked" when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid se-
quence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is 
expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked 
to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a 
coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, "operably linked" means that the DNA 
sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase However, 
enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites 


EP 1 623 990 B1

do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or tinkers are used in accordance with conventional practice. 
[0082] The term "antibody" is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers, for example, single anti-PRO7133 
monoclonal antibodies (including antagonist, and neutralizing antibodies). anti-PRO7133 antibody compositions with 
polyepitopic specificity, single chain anti-PRO7133 antibodies, and fragments of anti-PRO7133 antibodies (see below). 
The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homo-
geneous antibodies. i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally-
occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. 
[0083] "Stringency" of hybridization reactions is readily determinable by one of ordinary skill in the art, and generally 
is an empirical calculation dependent upon probe length, washing temperature, and salt concentration. In general, longer 
probes require higher temperatures for proper annealing, white shorter probes need lower temperatures. Hybridization 
generally depends on the ability of denatured DNA to reanneal when complementary strands are present in an environ-
ment below their melting temperature. The higher the degree of desired homology between the probe and hybridizable 
sequence, the higher the relative temperature which can be used. As a result, it follows that higher relative temperatures 
would tend to make the reaction conditions more stringent, while lower temperatures less so. For additional details and 
explanation of stringency of hybridization reactions, see Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Wiley 
Interscience Publishers, (1995). 
[0084] "Stringent conditions" or "high stringency conditions", as defined herein, may be identified by those that: (1) 
employ low ionic strength and high temperature for washing, for example 0.015 M sodium chloride/0.0015 M sodium 
citrate/0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50˚C; (2) employ during hybridization a denaturing agent, such as formamide, 
for example, 50% (v/v) formamide with 0.1% bovine serum albumin/0.1% Ficoll/0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone/50mM sodium 
phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 750 mM sodium chloride. 75 mM sodium citrate at 42˚C; or (3) employ 50% formamide. 
5 x SSC (0.75-M NaCl, 0.075 M sodium citrate). 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 5 x 
Denhardt's solution, sonicated salmon sperm DNA (50 mg/ml), 0.1% SDS, and 10% dextran sulfate at 42˚C, with washes 
at 42˚C in 0.2 x SSC (sodium chloride/sodium citrate) and 50% formamide at 55˚C, followed by a high-stringency wash 
consisting of 0.1 x SSC containing EDTA at 55˚C. 
[0085] "Moderately stringent conditions" may be identified as described by Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A 
Laboratory Manual. New York: Cold Spring Harbor Press. 1989, and include the use of washing solution and hybridization 
conditions (e.g., temperature, ionic strength and % SDS) less stringent than those described above. An example of 
moderately stringent conditions is overnight incubation at 37˚C in a solution comprising: 20% formamide, 5 x SSC (150 
mM NaCl. 15 mM trisodium citrate). 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5 x Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, 
and 20 mg/ml denatured sheared salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the filters in 1 x SSC at about 35˚C-50˚C. 
The skilled artisan will recognize how to adjust the temperature, ionic strength, etc. as necessary to accommodate 
factors such as probe length and the like. 
[0086] The term "epitope tagged" when used herein refers to a chimeric polypeptide comprising a PRO7133 polypeptide 
fused to a "tag polypeptide". The tag polypeptide has enough residues to provide an epitope against which an antibody 
can be made, yet is short enough such that it does not interfere with activity of the polypeptide to which it is fused. The 
tag polypeptide preferably also is fairly unique so that the antibody does not substantially cross-react with other epitopes. 
Suitable tag polypeptides generally have at least six amino acid residues and usually between about 8 and 50 amino 
acid residues (preferably, between about 10 and 20 amino acid residues). 
[0087] "Active" or "activity" for the purposes herein refers to form(s) of PRO7133 polypeptides which retain a biological 
and/or an immunological activity/property of a native or naturally-occurring PRO7133 polypeptide, wherein "biological" 
activity refers to a function (either inhibitory or stimulatory) caused by a native or naturally-occurring PRO7133 polypeptide 
other than the ability to induce the production of an antibody against an antigenic epitope possessed by a native or 
naturally-occurring PRO7133 polypeptide and an "immunological" activity refers to the ability to induce the production 
of an antibody against an antigenic epitope possessed by a native or naturally-occurring PRO7133 polypeptide. 
[0088] "Biological activity" in the context of an antibody or another antagonist molecule that can be identified by the 
screening assays disclosed herein (e.g., an organic or inorganic small molecule, peptide, etc.) is used to refer to the 
ability of such molecules to bind or complex with the polypeptides encoded by the amplified genes identified herein, or 
otherwise interfere with the interaction of the encoded polypeptides with other cellular proteins or otherwise interfere 
with the transcription or translation of a PRO7133 polypeptide. A preferred biological activity is growth inhibition of a 
target tumor cell. Another preferred biological activity is cytotoxic activity resulting in the death of the target tumor cell. 
[0089] The term "biological activity" in the context of a PRO7133 polypeptide means the ability of a PRO7133 polypep-
tide to induce neoplastic cell growth or uncontrolled cell growth. 
[0090] The phrase "immunological activity" means immunological cross-reactivity with at least one epitope of PRO7133 
polypeptide. 
[0091] "Immunological cross-reactivity" as used herein means that the candidate polypeptide is capable of competi-
tively inhibiting the qualitative biological activity of a PRO7133 polypeptide having this activity with polyclonal antisera 
raised against the known active PRO7133 polypeptide. Such antisera are prepared in conventional fashion by injecting 


EP 1 623 990 B1 

33 

5 





















goats or rabbits, for example, subcutaneously with the known active analogue in complete Freund's adjuvant, followed 
by booster intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection in incomplete Freunds. The immunological cross-reactivity preferably 
is "specific", which means that the binding affinity of the immunologically cross-reactive molecule (e.g., antibody) iden-
tified, to the corresponding PRO7133 polypeptide is significantly higher (preferably at least about 2-times, more preferably 
at least about 4-times, even more preferably at least about 8-times, most preferably at least about 10-times higher) than 
the binding affinity of that molecule to any other known native polypeptide. 
[0092] The term "antagonist" is used in the broadest sense, and includes any molecule that partially or fully blocks, 
inhibits, or neutralizes a biological activity of a native PRO7133 polypeptide disclosed herein or the transcription or 
translation thereof. Suitable antagonist molecules specifically include antagonist antibodies or antibody fragments, frag-
ments, peptides, small organic molecules, anti-sense nucleic acids, etc. Included are methods for identifying antagonists 
of a PRO7133 polypeptide with a candidate antagonist molecule and measuring a detectable change in one or more 
biological activities normally associated with the PRO7133 polypeptide. 
[0093] A "small molecule" is defined herein to have a molecular weight below about 500 Daltons. 
[0094] "Antibodies" (Abs) and "immunoglobulins" (Igs) are glycoproteins having the same structural characteristics. 
While antibodies exhibit binding specificity to a specific antigen, immunoglobulins include both antibodies and other 
antibody-like molecules which lack antigen specificity. Polypeptides of the latter land are, for example, produced at low 
levels by the lymph system and at increased levels by myelomas. The term "antibody" is used in the broadest sense 
and specifically covers, without limitation, intact monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies 
(e.g., bispecific antibodies) formed from at least two intact antibodies, and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit 
the desired biological activity. 
[0095] "Native antibodies" and "native immunoglobulins" are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 
daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a 
heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies among the heavy chains of 
different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and lightchain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. 
Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (V H ) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain 
has a variable domain at one end (V L ) and a constant domain at its other end; the constant domain of the light chain is 
aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light-chain variable domain is aligned with the variable 
domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light-and 
heavy-chain variable domains. 
[0096] The term "variable" refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence 
among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. 
However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in 
three segments called complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) or hypervariable regions both in the light-chain and 
the heavy-chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework 
(FR) regions. The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a 
β-sheet configuration, connected by three CDRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the 
β-sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and, with the CDRs 
from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., NTH Publ. 
No.91-3242, Vol. I, pages 647-669 (1991)). The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an 
antigen, but exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody-dependent cellular toxicity. 
[0097] The term "hypervariable region" when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are 
responsible for antigen-binding. The hypervariable region comprises amino acid residues from a "complementarity 
determining region" or "CDR" (i.e., residues 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the light chain variable domain 
and 31-35 (H1), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins 
of Immnunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institute of Health, Bethesda. MD. [1991]) and/or 
those residues from a "hypervariable loop" (i.e., residues 26-32 (Ll), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light chain variable 
domain and 26-32 (H1). 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain ; Clothia and Lesk, J. Mol. 
Biol., 196:901-917 [1987]). "Framework" or "FR" residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable 
region residues as herein defined. 
[0098] "Antibody fragments" comprise a portion of an intact antibody, preferably the antigen binding or variable region 
of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab') 2 , and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear 
antibodies (Zapata et al., Protein Eng.,8(10):1057-1062 [1995]); single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific 
antibodies formed from antibody fragments. 
[0099] Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called "Fab" fragments, each 
with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual "Fc" fragment, whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. 
Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab') 2 fragment that has two antigen-combining sites and is still capable of cross-linking 
antigen. 
[0100] "Pv" is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and -binding site. This 


EP 1 623 990 B1

5 





















region consists of a dimer of one heavy-and one light-chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. It is in 
this configuration that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface 
of the V H -V L dimer. Collectively, the six CDRs confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single 
variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and 
bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site. 
[0101] The Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH1) of 
the heavy chain. Fab fragments differ from Fab' fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of 
the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab'-SH is the designation 
herein for Fab' in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(ab') 2 antibody fragments 
originally were produced as pairs of Fab' fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings 
of antibody fragments are also known. 
[0102] The "light chains" of antibodies (immunoglobulins) from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two 
clearly distinct types, called kappa (κ) and lambda (λ), based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. 
[0103] Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, immunoglobulins can be 
assigned todifferentclasses. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM. and several of 
these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2. The heavy-chain 
constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called α, δ, ε, γ, and m, respectively. The 
subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known. 
[0104] The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially 
homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible 
naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being 
directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations which 
typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is 
directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are 
advantageous in that they are synthesized by the hybridoma culture, uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins. The 
modifier "monoclonal" indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous 
population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. 
For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the 
hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., Nature, 256:495 [1975], or may be made by recombinant DNA methods 
(see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567). The "monoclonal antibodies" may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries 
using the techniques described in Clackson et al., Nature, 352:624-628 [1991] and Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597 
(1991), for example. 
[0105] The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include "chimeric" antibodies (immunoglobulins) in which a por-
tion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived 
from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is 
identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to 
another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological 
activity (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567; Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 81:6851-6855 [1984]). 
[0106] "Humanized" forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin 
chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab', F(ab), or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) which 
contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human 
immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a CDR of the recipient are replaced by residues from a 
CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity, and 
capacity. In some instances. Fv FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human 
residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody 
nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. These modifications are made to further refine and maximize antibody 
performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable 
domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and 
all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody 
optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human 
immunoglobulin. For further details, see, Jones et al., Nature, 321:522-525 (1986); Reichmann et al., Nature. 332: 
323-329 [1988]; and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol., 2:593-596 (1992). The humanized antibody includes a PRIMATIZED ™ 
antibody wherein the antigen-binding region of the antibody is derived from an antibody produced by immunizing macaque 
monkeys with the antigen of interest. 
[0107] "Single-chain Fv" or "sFv" antibody fragments comprise the V H and V L domains of antibody, wherein these 
domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Preferably, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker 
between the V H and V L domains which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review 
of sFv see Pluckthun in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-

Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994). 
[0108] The term "diabodies" refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments com-
prise a heavy-chain variable domain (V H ) connected to a light-chain variable domain (V L ) in the same polypeptide chain 
(V H -V L ). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains 
are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies 
are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; and Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 
90:6444-6448 (1993). 
[0109] An "isolated" antibody is one which has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of 
its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with 
diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or 
nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of 
antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient 
to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) 
to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver 
stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the 
antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least 
one purification step. 
[0110] The word "label" when used herein refers to a detectable compound or composition which is conjugated directly 
or indirectly to the antibody so as to generate a "labeled" antibody. The label may be detectable by itself (e.g., radioisotope 
labels or fluorescent labels) or, in the case of an enzymatic label, may catalyze chemical alteration of a substrate 
compound or composition which is detectable. Radionuclides that can serve as detectable labels include, for example, 
I-131, I-123,I-125, Y-90. Re-188, Re-186, At-211, Cu-67, Bi-212, and Pd-109. The label may also be a non-detectable 
entity such as a toxin. 
[0111] By "solid phase" is meant a non-aqueous matrix to which the antibody of the present invention can adhere. 
Examples of solid phases encompassed herein include those formed partially or entirely of glass (e.g.. controlled pore 
glass), Polysaccharides (e.g., agarose), polyacrylamides, polystyrene, polyvinyl alcohol and silicones. In certain em-
bodiments, depending on the context, the solid phase can comprise the well of an assay plate; in others it is a purification 
column (e.g., an affinity chromatography column). This term also includes a discontinuous solid phase of discrete 
particles, such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 4,275,149. 
[0112] A "liposome" is a small vesicle composed of various types of lipids, phospholipids and/or surfactant which is 
useful for delivery of a drug (such as a PRO7133 polypeptide or antibody thereto and, optionally, a chemotherapeutic 
agent) to a mammal. The components of the liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer formation, similar to the lipid 
arrangement of biological membranes. 
[0113] As used herein, the term "immunoadhesin" designates antibody-like molecules which combine the binding 
specificity of a heterologous protein (an "adhesin") with the effector functions of immunoglobulin constant domains. 
Structurally, the immunoadhesins comprise a fusion of an amino acid sequence with the desired binding specificity which 
is other than the antigen recognition and binding site of an antibody (i.e., is "heterologous"). and an immunoglobulin 
constant domain sequence. The adbesin part of an immunoadhesin molecule typically is a contiguous amino acid 
sequence comprising at least the binding site of a receptor or a ligand. The immunoglobulin constant domain sequence 
in the immunoadhesin may be obtained from any immunoglobulin, such as IgG-1, IgG-2. IgG-3, or IgG-4 subtypes, IgA 
(including IgA-1 and IgA-2).IgE. IgD or IgM. 

II. Compositions and Methods of the Invention 

A. Full-length 

[0114] PRO7133 polypeptides 
[0115] The present invention provides newly identified and isolated nucleotide sequences encoding polypeptides 
referred to in the present application as PRO7133. In particular, cDNA encoding PRO7133 polypeptides has been 
identified and isolated, as disclosed in further detail in the Examples below. It is noted that proteins produced in separate 
expression rounds may be given different PRO numbers but the UNQ number is unique for any given DNA and the 
encoded protein, and will not be changed. However, for sake of simplicity, in the present specification the proteins 
encoded by the herein disclosed nucleic acid sequences as well as all further native homologues and variants included 
in the foregoing definition of PRO7133 will be referred to as 'PRO7133', regardless of their origin or mode of preparation. 
[0116] As disclosed in the Examples below, cDNA clones have been deposited with the ATCC. The actual nucleotide 
sequence of the clones can readily be determined by the skilled artisan by sequencing of the deposited clone using 
routine methods in the art. The predicted amino acid sequences can be determined from the nucleotide sequences 
using routine skill. For the PRO7133 polypeptides and encoding nucleic acid described herein, Applicants have identified 


EP 1 623 990 B1 

36 

5 





















what are believed to be the reading frames best identifiable with the sequence information available at the time. 

B. PRO7133 Variants 

[0117] In addition to the full-length native sequence PRO7133 polypeptides described herein, it is contemplated that 
PRO7133 variants can be prepared. PRO7133 variants can be prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes 
into the PRO7133 DNA, and/or by synthesis of the desired PRO7133 polypeptide. Those skilled in the art will appreciate 
that amino acid changes may alter post-translational processes of the PRO7133 such as changing the number or position 
of glycosylation sites or altering the membrane anchoring characteristics. 
[0118] Variations in the native full-length sequence PRO7133 or in various domains of the PRO7133 described herein, 
can be made, for example, using any of the techniques and guidelines for conservative and non-conservative mutations 
set forth, for instance, in U.S. Patent No. 5.364,934. Variations may be a substitution, deletion or insertion of one or 
more codons encoding the PRO7133 that results in a change in the amino acid sequence of the PRO7133 as compared 
with the native sequence PRO7133. Optionally the variation is by substitution of at least one amino acid with any other 
amino acid in one or more of the domains of the PRO7133 Guidance in determining which amino acid residue may be 
inserted, substituted or deleted without adversely affecting the desired activity may be found by comparing the sequence 
of the PRO7133 with that of homologous known protein molecules and minimizing the number of amino acid sequence 
changes made in regions of high homology. Amino acid substitutions can be the result of replacing one amino acid with 
another amino acid having similar structural and/or chemical properties, such as the replacement of a leucine with a 
serine, i.e., conservative amino acid replacements. Insertions or deletions may optionally be in the range of about 1 to 
5 amino acids. The variation allowed may be determined by systematically making insertions, deletions or substitutions 
of amino acids in the sequence and testing the resulting variants for activity exhibited by the full-length or mature native 
sequence. 
[0119] PRO7133 polypeptide fragments are provided herein. Such fragments may be truncated at the N-terminus or 
C-terminus, or may lack internal residues, for example, when compared with a full-length native protein. Certain fragments 
lack amino acid residues that are not essential for a desired biological activity of the PRO7133 polypeptide. 
[0120] PRO7133 fragments may be prepared by any of a number of conventional techniques. Desired peptide frag-
ments may be chemically synthesized. An alternative approach involves generating PRO7133 fragments by enzymatic 
digestion, e.g., by treating the protein with an enzyme known to cleave proteins at sites defined by particular amino acid 
residues, or by digesting the DNA with suitable restriction enzymes and isolating the desired fragment. Yet another 
suitable technique involves isolating and amplifying a DNA fragment encoding a desired polypeptide fragment, by 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Oligonucleotides that define the desired termini of the DNA fragment are employed 
at the 5' and 3' primers in the PCR. Preferably, PRO7133 polypeptide fragments share at least one biological and/or 
immunological activity with the native PRO7133 polypeptide. 
[0121] In particular embodiments, conservative substitutions of interest are shown in Table 3 under the heading of 
preferred substitutions. If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity, then more substantial changes, 
denominated exemplary substitutions in Table 3, or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes, are 
introduced and the products screened.

[0122] Substantial modifications in function or immunological identity of the polypeptide are accomplished by selecting 
substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the 
area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule 
at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common 
side-chain properties: 

(1) hydrophobic: norleucine, met, ala, val, leu, ile; 
(2) neutral hydrophilic: cys, ser, thr; 
(3) acidic: asp, glu; 
(4) basic: asn, gln, his, lys, arg; 
(5) residues that influence chain orientation: gly, pro; and 
(6) aromatic: trp, tyr, phe. 

[0123] Non-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class. Such 
substituted residues also may be introduced into the conservative substitution sites or, more preferably, into the remaining 
(non-conserved) sites. 
[0124] The variations can be made using methods known in the art such as oligonucleotide-mediated (site-directed) 
mutagenesis, alanine scanning, and PCR mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis [Carter et al., Nucl, Acids Res., 13: 
4331 (1986); Zoller et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 10:6487 (1987)], cassette mutagenesis [Wells et al., Gene, 34:315 (1985)], 
restriction selection mutagenesis [Wells et al., Philos, Trans. R. Soc. London SerA, 317:415 (1986)] or other known 
techniques can be performed on the cloned DNA to produce the PRO7133 variant DNA. 
[0125] Scanning amino acid analysis can also be employed to identify one or more amino acids along a contiguous 
sequence. Among the preferred scanning amino acids are relatively small, neutral amino acids. Such amino acids include 
alanine, glycine, serine, and cysteine. Alanine is typically a preferred scanning amino acid among this group because 
it eliminates the side-chain beyond the beta-carbon and is less likely to alter the main-chain conformation of the variant 
[Cunningham and Wells, Science, 244: 1081-1085 (1989)]. Alanine is also typically preferred because it is the most 
common amino acid. Further, it is frequently found in both buried and exposed positions [Creighton, The Proteins, (W.H. 
Freeman &amp; Co., N.Y.); Chothia. J. Mol. Biol., 150:1 (1976)]. If alanine substitution does not yield adequate amounts of 
variant, an isoteric amino acid can be used. 

C. Modifications of PRO7133 

[0126] Covalent modifications of PRO7133 are included within the scope of this invention. One type of covalent 
modification includes reacting targeted amino acid residues of a PRO7133 polypeptide with an organic derivatizing agent 
that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N-or C-terminal residues of the PRO7133. Derivatization 
with bifunctional agents is useful, for instance, for crosslinking PRO7133 to a water-insoluble support matrix or surface 
for use in the method for purifying anti-PRO7133 antibodies, and vice-versa. Commonly used crosslinking agents include, 
e.g., 1,1-bis(diazoacetyl)-2-phenylethane, glutaraldehyde, N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, for example, esters with 4-
azidosalicylic acid, homobifunctional imidoesters, including disuccinimidyl esters such as 3,3'-dithiobis(succinimidylpro-
pionate), bifunctional maleimides such as bis-N-mateimido-1.8-octane and agents such as methyl-3-[(p-azidophenyl) 
dithio]propioiaddate. 
[0127] Other modifications include deamidation of glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues to the corresponding glutamyl 
and aspartyl residues, respectively, hydroxylation of proline and lysine, phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or 
threonyl residues, methylation of the α-amino groups of lysine, arginine, and histidine side chains [T.E. Creighton,

Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties, W.H. Freeman &amp; Co., San Francisco, pp. 79-86 (1983)], acetylation of 
the N-terminal amine, and amidation of any C-terminal carboxyl group. 
[0128] Another type of covalent modification of the PRO7133 polypeptide included within the scope of this invention 
comprises altering the native glycosylation pattern of the polypeptide. "Altering the native glycosylation pattern" is in-
tended for purposes herein to mean deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in native sequence PRO7133 
(either by removing the underlying glycosylation site or by deleting the glycosylation by chemical and/or enzymatic 
means), and/or adding one or more glycosylation sites that are not present in the native sequence PRO7133. In addition, 
the phrase includes qualitative changes in the glycosylation of the native proteins, involving a change in the nature and 
proportions of the various carbohydrate moieties present. 
[0129] Addition of glycosylation sites to the PRO7133 polypeptide may be accomplished by altering the amino acid 
sequence. The alteration may be made, for example, by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine 
residues to the native sequence PRO7133 (for O-linked glycosylation sites). The amino acid sequence may optionally 
be altered through changes at the DNA level, particularly by mutating the DNA encoding the PRO7133 polypeptide at 
preselected bases such that codons are generated that will translate into the desired amino acids. 
[0130] Another means of increasing the number of carbohydrate moieties on the PRO7133 polypeptide is by chemical 
or enzymatic coupling of glycosides to the polypeptide. Such methods are described in the art, e.g., in WO 87/05330 
published 11 September 1987, and in Aplin and Wriston. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. pp. 259-306 (1981). 
[0131] Removal of carbohydrate moieties present on the PRO7133 polypeptide may be accomplished chemically or 
enzymatically or by mutational substitution of codons encoding for amino acid residues that serve as targets for glyco-
sylation. Chemical deglycosylation techniques are known in the art and described, for instance, by Hakimuddin, et al., 
Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 259:52 (1981) and by Edge et al., Anal. Biochem., 118:131 (1981). Enzymatic cleavage of 
carbohydrate moieties on polypeptides can be achieved by the use of a variety of endo-and exo-glycosidases as 
described by Thotakura et al., Meth. Enzymol. 138:350 (1987). 
[0132] Another type of covalent modification of PRO7133 comprises linking the PRO7133 polypeptide to one of a 
variety of nonproteinaceous polymers. e.g., polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol, or polyoayalkylenes, in 
the manner set forth in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,640.835; 4,496,689: 4,301.144; 4,670,417; 4,791.192 or 4,119,337. 
[0133] The PRO7133 of the present invention may also be modified in a way to form a chimeric molecule comprising 
PRO7133 fused to another, heterologous polypeptide or amino acid sequence. 
[0134] In one embodiment, such a chimeric molecule comprises a fusion of the PRO7133 with a tag polypeptide which 
provides an epitope to which an anti-tag antibody can selectively bind. The epitope tag is generally placed at the amino-
or carboxyl-terminus of the PRO7133. The presence of such epitope-tagged forms of the PRO7133 can be detected 
using an antibody against the tag polypeptide. Also, provision of the epitope tag enables the PRO7133 to be readily 
purified by affinity purification using an anti-tag antibody or another type of affinity matrix that binds to the epitope tag. 
Various tag polypeptides and their respective antibodies are well known in the art. Examples include poly-histidine (poly-
His) or poly-histidine-glycine (poly-His-gly) tags; the flu HA tag polypeptide and its antibody 12CA5 [Field et al., Mol. 
Cell. Biol., 8:2159-2165 (1988)]; the c-myc tag and the 8F9, 3C7, 6E10, G4, B7 and 9B10 antibodies thereto [Evan et 
al., Molecular and Cellular Biology, 5:3610-3616 (1985)]; and the Herpes Simplex virus glycoprotein D (gD) tag and its 
antibody [Paborsky et al., Protein Engineering, 3(6):547-553 (1990)]. Other tag polypeptides include the Flag-peptide 
[Hopp et al., BioTechnology, 6:1204-1210 (1988)]; the KT3 epitope peptide [Martin et al., Science, 255:192-194 (1992)]; 
an α-tubulin epitope peptide [Skinner et al., J. Biol. Chem.. 266:15163-15166 (1991)]; and the T7 gene 10 protein peptide 
tag [Lutz-Freyermuth et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87:6393-6397 (1990)]. 
[0135] In an alternative embodiment, the chimeric molecule may comprise a fusion of the PRO7133 with an immu-
noglobulin or a particular region of an immunoglobulin. For a bivalent form of the chimeric molecule (also referred to as 
an "immunoadhesin"), such a fusion could be to the Fc region of an IgG molecule. The Ig fusions preferably include the 
substitution of a soluble (transmembrane domain deleted or inactivated) form of a PRO7133 polypeptide in place of at 
least one variable region within an Ig molecule. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the immunoglobulin fusion 
includes the hinge. CH2 and CH3. or the hinge, CH1, CH2 and CH3 regions of an IgG1 molecule. For the production 
of immunoglobulin fusions see also, US Patent No. 5,428,130 issued June 27, 1995. 

D. Preparation of PRO7133 Polypeptides 

[0136] The description below relates primarily to production of PRO7133 by culturing cells transformed or transfected 
with a vector containing PRO7133 nucleic acid. It is, of course, contemplated that alternative methods, which are well 
known in the art, may be employed to prepare, PRO7133 For instance, the PRO7133 sequence, or portions thereof, 
may be produced by direct peptide synthesis using solid-phase techniques [see, e.g., Stewart et al., Solid-Phase Peptide 
Synthesis, W.H. Freeman Co., San Francisco, CA (1969); Merrifield, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 85:2149-2154 (1963)]. In vitro 
protein synthesis may be performed using manual techniques or by automation. Automated synthesis may be accom-
plished, for instance, using an Applied Biosystems Peptide Synthesizer (Foster City, CA) using manufacturer's instruc-


EP 1 623 990 B1

5 





















tions. Various portions of the PRO7133 may be chemically synthesized separately and combined using chemical or 
enzymatic methods to produce the full-length 

a. Isolation of DNA Encoding a 

PRO7133 Polypeptide 

[0137] DNA encoding PRO7133 may be obtained from a cDNA library prepared from tissue believed to possess the 
PRO7133 mRNA and to express it at a detectable level. Accordingly, human PRO7133 DNA can be conveniently obtained 
from a cDNA library prepared from human tissue, such as described in the Examples. PRO7133 gene may also be 
obtained from a genomic library or by oligonucleotide synthesis. 
[0138] Libraries can be screened with probes (such as antibodies to the PRO7133 polypeptide, or oligonucleotides 
of at least about 20-80 bases) designed to identify the gene of interest or the protein encoded by it. Screening the cDNA 
or genomic library with the selected probe may be conducted using standard procedures, such as described in Sambrook 
et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989). An alternative 
means to isolate the gene encoding PRO7133 is to use PCR methodology [Sambrook et al., supra; Dieffenbach et al., 
PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1995)]. 
[0139] The Examples below describe techniques for screening a cDNA library. The oligonucleotide sequences selected 
as probes should be of sufficient length and sufficiently unambiguous that false positives are minimized. The oligonu-
cleotide is preferably labeled such that it can be detected upon hybridization to DNA in the library being screened. 
Methods of labeling are well known in the art, and include the use of radiolabels like "P-labeled ATP, biotinylation or 
enzyme labeling. Hybridization conditions, including moderate stringency and high stringency, are provided in Sambrook 
et al., supra. 
[0140] Sequences identified in such library screening methods can be compared and aligned to other known sequences 
deposited and available in public databases such as GenBank or other private sequence databases. Sequence identity 
(at either the amino acid or nucleotide level) within defined regions of the molecule or across the full-length sequence 
can be determined using methods known in the art and as described herein. 
[0141] Nucleic acid having protein coding sequence may be obtained by screening selected cDNA or genomic libraries 
using the deduced amino acid sequence disclosed herein for the first time, and, if necessary, using conventional primer 
extension procedures as described in Sambrook et al., supra, to detect precursors and processing intermediates of 
mRNA that may not have been reverse-transcribed into cDNA. 

b. Selection and Transformation of Host Cells 

[0142] Host cells are transfected or transformed with expression or cloning vectors described herein for PRO7133 
production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting trans-
formants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences. The culture conditions, such as media, temperature, 
pH and the like, can be selected by the skilled artisan without undue experimentation. In general, principles, protocols, 
and practical techniques for maximizing the productivity of cell cultures can be found in Mammalian Cell Biotechnology: 
a Practical Approach. M. Butler, ed. (IRL Press, 1991) and Sambrook et al., supra. 
[0143] Methods of eukaryotic cell transfection and prokaryotic cell transformation are known to the ordinarily skilled 
artisan, for example, CaCl 2 , CaPO 4 , liposome-mediated and electroporation. Depending on the host cell used, trans-
formation is performed using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium 
chloride, as described in Sambrook et al., supra, or electroporation is generally used for prokaryotes. Infection with 
Agrobacterium tumefaciens is used for transformation of certain plant cells, as described by Shaw et al., Gene. 23:315 
(1983) and WO 89/05859 published 29 June 1989. For mammalian cells without such ceU walls, the calcium phosphate 
precipitation method of Graham and van der Eb, Virology, 52:456-457 (1978) can be employed. General aspects of 
mammalian cell host system transfections have been described in U.S. Patent No. 4,399,216. Transformations into 
yeast are typically carried out according to the method of Van Solingen et al., J. Bact., 130:946 (1977) and Hsiao et al., 
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 76:3829 (1979). However, other methods for introducing DNA into cells, such as by nuclear 
microinjection, electroporation, bacterial protoplast fusion with intact cells, or polycations, e.g., polybrene, polyornithine, 
may also be used. For various techniques for transforming mammalian cells, see, Keown et al., Methods in Enzymology, 
185:521-537 (1990) and Mansour et al., Nature, 336:348-352 (1988). 
[0144] Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein include prokaryote, yeast, or higher 
eukaryote cells. Suitable prokaryotes include but are not limited to eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive 
organisms, for example, Enterobacteriaceae such as E. coli. Various E. coli strains are publicly available, such as E. 
coli K12 strain MM294 (ATCC 31,446): E. coli X1776 (ATCC 31,537); E. coli strain W3110 (ATCC 27,325) and E. coli 
strain K5 772 (ATCC 53,635). Other suitable prokaryotic host cells include Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia.

e.g., E. coli, Enterobacter, Erwinia. Klebsiella, Proteus, Salmonella, e.g., Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia, eg., Serratia 
marcescans, and Shigella, as well as Bacilli such as B. subtilis and B. licheniformis (e.g., B. licheniformis 41P disclosed 
in DD 266,710 published 12 April 1989), Pseudomonas such as P. aeruginosa, and Streptomyces. These examples 
are illustrative rather than limiting. Strain W3110 is one particularly preferred host or parent host because it is a common 
host strain for recombinant DNA product fermentations. Preferably, the host cell secretes minimal amounts of proteolytic 
enzymes. For example, strain W3110 may be modified to effect a genetic mutation in the genes encoding proteins 
endogenous to the host, with examples of such hosts including E. coli W3110 strain 1A2, which has the complete 
genotype tonA : E. coli W3110 strain 9E4, which has the complete genotype tonA ptr3; E. coli W3110 strain 27C7 (ATCC 
55,244), which has the complete genotype tonA ptr3 phoA E15 (argF-lac)169 degP ompTkan r : E. coli W3110 strain 
37D6, which has the complete genotype tonA ptr3 phoA E15 (argF-lac) 169 degP ompT rbs7 ilvG kan r ; E. coli W3110 
strain 40B4, which is strain 37D6 with a non-kanamycin resistant degP deletion mutation; and an E. coli strain having 
mutant periplasmic protease disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,946,783 issued 7 August 1990. Alternatively, in vitro methods 
of cloning. e.g., PCR or other nucleic acid polymerase reactions, are suitable. 
[0145] In addition to prokaryotes, eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are suitable cloning or 
expression hosts for PRO7133 vectors. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a commonly used lower eukaryotic host micro-
organism. Others include Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Beach and Nurse. Nature. 290: 140 [1981]; EP 139,383 pub-
lished 2 May 1985); Kluyveromyces hosts (U.S. Patent No. 4,943,529; Fleer et al., BiolTechnology, 9:968-975 (1991))

(EP 244,234); Neurospora crassa (Case et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 76:5259-5263 [1979]); Schwanniomyces 
such as Schwanniomyces occidentalis (EP 394.538 published 31 October 1990); and filamentous fungi such as, e.g., 
Neurospora, Penicillium, Tolypocladium (WO 91/00357 published 10 January 1991), and Aspergillus hosts such as A. 
nidulans (Ballance et al., Biochem. Biophys, Res. Commun., 112:284-289 [1983]; Tilburn et al., Gene, 26:205.221 [1983]: 
Yelton et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 81:1470-1474 [1984]) and A. niger (Kelly and Hynes, EMBO J., 4:475-479 
[1985]). Methylotropic yeasts are suitable herein and include, but are not limited to, yeast capable of growth on methanol 
selected from the genera consisting of Hansenula, Candida, Kloeckera, Pichia, Saccharomyces, Torulopsis, and Rho-
dotorula. A list of specific species that are exemplary of this class of yeasts may be found in C. Anthony. The Biochemistry 
of Methylotrophs, 269 (1982). 
[0146] Suitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated PRO7133 are derived from multicellular organisms. 
Examples of invertebrate cells include insect cells such as Drosophila S2 and Spodoptera Sf9, as well as plant cells. 
Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines include Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and COS cells. More specific 
examples include monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651); human embryonic kidney 
line (293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture. Graham et al., J. Gen, Virol., 36:59 (1977)); Chinese

HB 8065); and mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL51). The selection of the appropriate host cell is 
deemed to be within the skill in the art. 

c. Selection and Use of a Replicable Vector 

[0147] The nucleic acid (e.g., cDNA or genomic DNA) encoding PRO7133 may be inserted into a replicable vector 
for cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for expression. Various vectors are publicly available. The vector may, for 
example, be in the form of a plasmid, cosmid, viral particle, or phage. The appropriate nucleic acid sequence may be 
inserted into the vector by a variety of procedures. In general, DNA is inserted into an appropriate restriction endonuclease 
site(s) using techniques known in the art. Vector components generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of a 
signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription 
termination sequence. Construction of suitable vectors containing one or more of these components employs standard 
ligation techniques which are known to the skilled artisan. 
[0148] The PRO7133 may be produced recombinantly not only directly, but also as a fusion polypeptide with a het-
erologous polypeptide, which may be a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N-
terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide. In general, the signal sequence may be a component of the vector, or it 
may be a part of the PRO7133 DNA that is inserted into the vector. The signal sequence may be a prokaryotic signal 
sequence selected, for example, from the group of the alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, Ipp, or heat-stable enterotoxin 
II leaders. For yeast secretion the signal sequence may be, e.g., the yeast invertase leader, alpha factor leader (including 
Saccharomyces and Kluyveromyces α-factor leaders, the latter described in U.S. Patent No. 5,010,182), or acid phos-
phatase leader, the C. albicans glucoamylase leader (EP 362,179 published 4 April 1990), or the signal described in 


EP 1 623 990 B1 

41 

5 





















WO 90/13646 published 15 November 1990. In mammalian cell expression, mammalian signal sequences may be used 
to direct secretion of the protein, such as signal sequences from secreted polypeptides of the same or related species, 
as well as viral secretory leaders. 
[0149] Both expression and cloning vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that enables the vector to replicate in 
one or more selected host cells. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria, yeast, and viruses. The origin 
of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram-negative bacteria, the 2m plasmid origin is suitable for 
yeast, and various viral origins (SV40, polyoma, adenovirus, VSV or BPV) are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian 
cells. 
[0150] Expression and cloning vectors will typically contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable marker. Typical 
selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin, neomycin, 
methotrexate, or tetracycline, (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from 
complex media, e.g., the gene encoding D-alanine racemase for Bacilli. 
[0151] An example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells 
competent to take up the PRO7133 nucleic acid, such as DHFR or thymidine kinase. An appropriate host cell when 
wild-type DHFR is employed is the CHO cell line deficient in DHFR activity, prepared and propagated as described by 
Urlaub et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 77:4216 (1980). A suitable selection gene for use in yeast is the trp1 gene 
present in the yeast plasmid YRp7 [Stinchcomb et al., Nature, 282:39 (1979); Kingsman et al., Gene, 7:141 (1979); 
Tschemper et al., Gene, 10:157 (1980)]. The trp1 gene provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking 
the ability to grow in tryptophan, for example, ATCC No. 44076 or PEP4-1 [Jones, Genetics, 85:12 (1977)]. 
[0152] Expression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter operably linked to the PRO7133 nucleic acid se-
quence to direct mRNA synthesis. Promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells arc well known. Promoters 
suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the β-lactamase and lactose promoter systems [Chang et al., Nature, 
275:615 (1978); Goeddel et al., Nature. 281:544 (1979)], alkaline phosphatase, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system 
[Goeddel, Nucleic Acids Res., 8:4057 (1980); EP 36,776], and hybrid promoters such as the tac promoter [deBoer et 
al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, USA, 80:21-25 (1983)]. Promoters for use in bacterial systems also will contain a Shine-
Dalgamo (S.D.) sequence operably linked to the DNA encoding PRO7133. 
[0153] Examples of suitable promoting sequences for use with yeast hosts include the promoters for 3-phosphoglyc-
erate kinase [Hitzeman et al., J. Biol. Chem., 255:2073 (1980)] or other glycolytic enzymes [Hess et al., J. Adv. Enzyme 
Reg., 7:149 (1968); Holland, Biochemistry, 17:4900(1978)], such as enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydroge-
nase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 3-phosphoglycerate 
mutase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, and glucokinase. 
[0154] Other yeast promoters, which are inducible promoters having the additional advantage of transcription controlled 
by growth conditions, are the promoter regions for alcohol dehydrogenase 2, isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, 
degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism, metallothionein, glyceraldebyde-3-phosphate dehydroge-
nase, and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization. Suitable vectors and promoters for use in yeast 
expression are further described in EP 73,657. 
[0155] PRO7133 transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells is controlled, for example, by promoters obtained 
from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus (UK 2,211,504 published 5 July 1989), adenovirus 
(such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus 
and Simian Virus 40 (SV40), from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g., the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin 
promoter, and from heat-shock promoters, provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems. 
[0156] Transcription of a DNA encoding the PRO7133 by higher eukaryotes may be increased by inserting an enhancer 
sequence into the vector. Enhancers are cis-acting elements of DNA, usually about from 10 to 300 bp, that act on a 
promoter to increase its transcription. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, 
elastase, albumin, α-fetoprotein, and insulin). Typically, however, one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. 
Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early 
promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers. The 
enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5' or 3' to the PRO7133 coding sequence, but is preferably located 
at a site 5' from the promoter. 
[0157] Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells (yeast, fungi, insect, plant, animal, human, or nucleated cells 
from other multicellular organisms) will also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for 
stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5' and, occasionally 3', untranslated regions 
of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated frag-
ments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding PRO7133. 
[0158] Still other methods, vectors, and host cells suitable for adaptation to the synthesis of PRO7133 in recombinant 
vertebrate cell culture are described in Gething et al., Nature. 293:620-625 (1981); Mantei et al., Nature, 281:40-46 
(1979); EP 117.060; and EP 117.058.

d. Detecting Gene Amplification/Expression 

[0159] Gene amplification and/or expression may be measured in a sample directly, for example, by conventional 
Southern blotting. Northern blotting to quantitate the transcription of mRNA [Thomas, Proc, Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 77: 
5201-5205 (1980)], dot blotting (DNA analysis), or in situ hybridization, using an appropriately labeled probe, based on 
the sequences provided herein. Alternatively, antibodies may be employed that can recognize specific duplexes, including 
DNA duplexes, RNA duplexes, and DNA-RNA hybrid duplexes or DNA-protein duplexes. The antibodies in turn may be 
labeled and the assay may be carried out where the duplex is bound to a surface, so that upon the formation of duplex 
on the surface, the presence of antibody bound to the duplex can be detected. 
[0160] Gene expression, alternatively, may be measured by immunological methods, such as immunohistochemical 
staining of cells or tissue sections and assay of cell culture or body fluids, to quantitate directly the expression of gene 
product. Antibodies useful for immunohistochemical staining and/or assay of sample fluids may be either monoclonal 
or polyclonal, and may be prepared in any mammal. Conveniently, the antibodies may be prepared against a native 
sequence PRO7133 polypeptide or against a synthetic peptide based on the DNA sequences provided herein or against 
an exogenous sequence fused to PRO7133 DNA and encoding a specific antibody epitope. 

e. Purification of Polypeptide 

[0161] Forms of PRO7133 may be recovered from culture medium or from host cell lysates. If membrane-bound, it 
can be released from the membrane using a suitable detergent solution (e.g., Triton-X 100)or by enzymatic cleavage. 
Cells employed in expression of PRO7133 can be disrupted by various physical or chemical means, such as freeze-
thaw cycling, sonication, mechanical disruption, or ceU lysing agents. 
[0162] It may be desired to purify PRO7133 from recombinant cell proteins or polypeptides. The following procedures 
are exemplary of suitable purification procedures: by fractionation on an ion-exchange column; ethanol precipitation: 
reverse phase HPLC; chromatography on silica or on a cation-exchange resin such as DEAE; chromatofocusing: SDS-
PAGE; ammonium sulfate precipitation; gel filtration using, for example, Sephadex G-75: protein A Sepharose columns 
to remove contaminants such as IgG; and metal chelating columns to bind epitope-tagged forms of the PRO7133. 
Various methods of protein purification may be employed and such methods are known in the art and described for 
example in Deutscher, Methods in Enzymology, 182 (1990); Scopes, Protein Purification:Principles and Practice, Spring-
er-Veriag, New York (1982). The purification step(s) selected will depend, for example, on the nature of the production 
process used and the particular PRO7133 produced. 

E. Amplification of Genes Encoding PRO7133 Polypeptides in Tumor Tissues and Cell Lines 

[0163] The present invention is based on the identification and characterization of genes that are amplified in certain 
cancer cells. 
[0164] The genome of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms is subjected to two seemingly conflicting requirements. 
One is the preservation and propagation of DNA as the genetic information in its original form, to guarantee stable 
inheritance through multiple generations. On the other hand, cells or organisms must be able to adapt to lasting envi-
ronmental changes. The adaptive mechanisms can include qualitative or quantitative modifications of the genetic material. 
Qualitative modifications include DNA mutations, in whichcoding sequences are altered resulting in a structurally and/or 
functionally different protein. Gene amplification is a quantitative modification, whereby the actual number of complete 
coding sequence, i.e., a gene, increases, leading to an increased number of available templates for transcription, an 
increased number of translatable transcripts, and, ultimately, to an increased abundance of the protein encoded by the 
amplified gene. 
[0165] The phenomenon of gene amplification and its underlying mechanisms have been investigated in vitro in 
several prokaryotic and eukaryotic culture systems. The best-characterized example of gene amplification involves the 
culture of eukaryotic cells in medium containing variable concentrations of the cytotoxic drug methotrexate (MTX). MTX 
is a folic acid analogue and interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). 
During the initial exposure to low concentrations of MTX most cells (&gt;99.9%) will die. A small number of cells survive, 
and are capable of growing in increasing concentrations of MTX by producing large amounts of DHFR-RNA and protein. 
The basis of this overproduction is the amplification of the single DHFR gene. The additional copies of the gene are 
found as extrachromosomal copies in the form of small, supernumerary chromosomes (double minutes) or as integrated 
chromosomal copies. 
[0166] Gene amplification is most commonly encountered in the development of resistance to cytotoxic drugs (anti-
biotics for bacteria and chemotherapeutic agents for eukaryotic cells) and neoplastic transformation. Transformation of 
a eukaryotic cell as a spontaneous event or due to a viral or chemical/environmental insult is typically associated with 
changes in the genetic material of that ceU. One of the most common genetic changes observed in human malignancies 


EP 1 623 990 B1 

43 

5 





















are mutations of the p53 protein. p53 controls the transition of cells from the stationary (Gl) to the replicative (S) phase 
and prevents this transition in the presence of DNA damage. In other words, one of the main consequences of disabling 
p53 mutations is the accumulation and propagation of DNA damage. i.e., genetic changes. Common types,of genetic 
changes in neoplastic cells are, in addition to point mutations, amplifications and gross, structural alterations, such as 
translocations. 
[0167] The amplification of DNA sequences may indicate a specific functional requirement as illustrated in the DHVR 
experimental system. Therefore, the amplification of certain oncogenes in malignancies points toward a causative role 
of these genes in the process of malignant transformation and maintenance of the transformed phenotype. This hypoth-
esis has gained support in recent studies. For example, the bcl-2 protein was found to be amplified in certain types of 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This protein inhibits apoptosis and leads to the progressive accumulation of neoplastic cells. 
Members of the gene family of growth factor receptors have been found to be amplified in various types of cancers 
suggesting that overexpression of these receptors may make neoplastic cells less susceptible to limiting amounts of 
available growth factor. Examples include the amplification of the androgen receptor in recurrent prostate cancer during 
androgen deprivation therapy and the amplification of the growth factor receptor homologue ERB2 in breast cancer. 
Lastly, genes involved in intracellular signaling and control of cell cycle progression can undergo amplification during 
malignant transformation. This is illustrated by the amplification of the bcl-I and ras genes in various epithelial and 
lymphoid neoplasms. 
[0168] These earlier studies illustrate the feasibility of identifying amplified DNA sequences in neoplasms, because 
this approach can identify genes important for malignant transformation. The case of ERB2 also demonstrates the 
feasibility from a therapeutic standpoint, since transforming proteins may represent novel and specific targets for tumor 
therapy. 
[0169] Several different techniques can be used to demonstrate amplified genomic sequences. Classical cytogenetic 
analysis of chromosome spreads prepared from cancer cells is adequate to identify gross structural alterations, such 
as translocations, deletions and inversions. Amplified genomic regions can only be visualized, if they involve large 
regions with high copy numbers or are present as extrachromosomal material. While cytogenetics was the first technique 
to demonstrate the consistent association of specific chromosomal changes with particular neoplasms, it is inadequate 
for the identification and isolation of manageable DNA sequences. The more recently developed technique of comparative 
genomic hybridization (CGH) has illustrated the widespread phenomenon of genomic amplification in neoplasms. Tumor 
and normal DNA are hybridized simultaneously onto metaphases of normal cells and the entire genome can be screened 
by image analysis for DNA sequences that are present in the tumor at an increased frequency. (WO93/18,186;Gray et 
al., Radiation Res., 137:275-289[1994]). As a screening method, this type of analysis has revealed a large number of 
recurring amplicons (a stretch of amplified DNA) in a variety of human neoplasms. Although CGH is more sensitive than 
classical cytogenetic analysis in identifying amplified stretches of DNA, it does not allow a rapid identification and isolation 
of coding sequences within the amplicon by standard molecular genetic techniques. 
[0170] The most sensitive methods to detect gene amplification are polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays. 
These assays utilize very small amount of tumor DNA as starting material, are exquisitely sensitive, provide DNA that 
is amenable to further analysis, such as sequencing and are suitable for high-volume throughput analysis. 
[0171] The above-mentioned assays are not mutually exclusive, but are frequently used in combination to identify 
amplifications in neoplasms. While cytogenetic analysis and CGH represent screening methods to survey the entire 
genome for amplified regions, PCR-based assays are most suitable for the final identification of coding sequences, i.e., 
genes in amplified regions. 
[0172] According to the present invention, such genes have been identified by quantitative PCR (S. Gelmini et al., 
Clin. Chem., 43:752 [1997]), by comparing DNA from a variety of primary tumors, including breast, lung, colon, prostate, 
brain, liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen, thymus, testis, ovary, uterus, etc., tumor, or tumor cell lines, with pooled DNA 
from healthy donors. Quantitative PCR was performed using a TaqMan ™ instrument (ABI). Gene-specific primers and 
fluorogenic probes were designed based upon the coding sequences of the DNAs.

F. Tissue Distribution 

[0181] The results of the gene amplification assays herein can be verified by further studies, such as, by determining 
mRNA expression in various human tissues. 
[0182] As noted before, gene amplification and/or gene expression in various tissues may be measured by conventional 
Southern blotting, Northern blotting to quantitate the transcription of mRNA (Thomas. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 77: 
5201-5205[1980], dot blotting(DNA analysis), or in situ hybridization, using an appropriately labeled probe, based on 
the sequences provided herein. Alternatively, antibodies may be employed that can recognize specific duplexes, including 
DNA duplexes. RNA duplexes, and DNA-RNA hybrid duplexes or DNA-protein duplexes. 
[0183] Gene expression in various tissues, alternatively, may be measured by immunological methods, such as im-
munohistochemical staining of tissue sections and assay of cell culture or body fluids, to quantitate directly the expression 
of gene product. Antibodies useful for immunohistochemical staining and/or assay of sample fluids may be either mon-
oclonal or polyclonal, and may be prepared in any mammal. Conveniently, the antibodies may be prepared against a 
native sequence. PRO7133 polypeptide or against a synthetic peptide based on the DNA sequences provided herein 
or against exogenous sequence fused to sequence PRO7133 DNA and encoding a specific antibody epitope. General 
techniques for generating antibodies, and special protocols for Northern blotting and in situ hybridization are provided 
hereinbelow. 

G. Chromosome Mapping 

[0184] If the amplification of a given gene is functionally relevant, then that gene should be amplified more than 


EP 1 623 990 B1 

45

neighboring genomic regions which are not important for tumor survival. To test this, the gene can be mapped to a 
particular chromosome, e.g., by radiation-hybrid analysis. The amplification level is then determined at the location 
identified, and at the neighboring genomic region. Selective or preferential amplification at the genomic region to which 
the gene has been mapped is consistent with the possibility that the gene amplification observed promotes tumor growth 
or survival. Chromosome mapping includes both framework and epicenter mapping. For further details see, e.g., Stewart 
et al., Genome Research, 7:422-433 (1997). 

H. Antibody Binding Studies 

[0185] The results of the gene amplification study can be further verified by antibody binding studies, in which the 
ability of anti-PRO7133 antibodies to inhibit the expression of PRO7133 polypeptides on tumor (cancer) cells is tested. 
Exemplary antibodies include polyclonal, monoclonal, humanized, bispecific, and heteroconjugate antibodies, the prep-
aration of which will be described hereinbelow. 
[0186] Antibody binding studies may be carried out in any known assay method, such as competitive binding assays, 
direct and indirect sandwich assays, and immunoprecipitation assays. Zola. Monoclonal Antibodies: A Manual of Tech-
niques, pp.147-158 (CRC Press, Inc., 1987). 
[0187] Competitive binding assays rely on the ability of a labeled standard to compete with the test sample analyte 
for binding with a limited amount of antibody. The amount of target protein (encoded by a gene amplified in a tumor cell) 
in the test sample is inversely proportional to the amount of standard that becomes bound to the antibodies. To facilitate 
determining the amount of standard that becomes bound, the antibodies preferably are insolubilized before or after the 
competition, so that the standard and analyte that are bound to the antibodies may conveniently be separated from the 
standard and analyte which remain unbound. 
[0188] Sandwich assays involve the use of two antibodies, each capable of binding to a different immunogenic portion, 
or epitope, of the protein to be detected. In a sandwich assay, the test sample analyte is bound by a first antibody which 
is immobilized on a solid support, and thereafter a second antibody binds to the analyte, thus forming an insoluble three-
part complex. See. e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,376,110. The second antibody may itself be labeled with a detectable moiety 
(direct sandwich assays) or may be measured using an anti-immunoglobulin antibody that is labeled with a detectable 
moiety (indirect sandwich assay). For example, one type of sandwich assay is an ELISA assay, in which case the 
detectable moiety is an enzyme. 
[0189] For immunohistochemistry, the tumor sample may be fresh or frozen or may be embedded in paraffin and fixed 
with a preservative such as formalin, for example. 

I. Cell-Based Tumor Assays 

[0190] Cell-based assays and animal models for tumors (e.g., cancers) can be used to verify the findings of the gene 
amplification assay, and further understand the relationship between the genes identified herein and the development 
and pathogenesis of neoplastic cell growth. The role of gene products identified herein in the development and pathology 
of tumor or cancer can be tested by using primary tumor cells or cells lines that have been identified to amplify the genes 
herein. Such cells include, for example, the breast, colon and lung cancer cells and cell lines listed above. 
[0191] In a different approach, cells of a cell type known to be involved in a particular tumor are transfected with the 
cDNAs herein, and the ability of these cDNAs to induce excessive growth is analyzed. Suitable cells include, for example, 
stable tumor ceUs lines such as, the B104-1-1 cell line (stable NIH-3T3 cell line transfected with the neu protooncogene) 
and ras-transfected NIH-3T3 cells, which can be transfected with the desired gene, and monitored for tumorogenic 
growth. Such transfected cell lines can then be used to test the ability of poly-or monoclonal antibodies or antibody 
compositions to inhibit tumorogenic cell growth by exerting cytostatic or cytotoxic activity on the growth of the transformed 
cells, or by mediating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Cells transfected with the coding sequences of 
the genes identified herein can further be used to identify drug candidates for the treatment of cancer. 
[0192] In addition, primary cultures derived from tumors in transgenic animals (as described below) can be used in 
the cell-based assays herein, although stable cell lines are preferred. Techniques to derive continuous cell lines from 
transgenic animals are well known in the art (see, e.g., Small et al., Mol. Cell. Biol., 5:642-648 [1985]). 

J. Animal Models 

[0193] A variety of well known animal models can be used to further understand the role of the genes identified herein 
in the development and pathogenesis of tumors, and to test the efficacy of candidate therapeutic agents, including 
antibodies, and other antagonists of the native polypeptides, including small molecule antagonists. The in vivo nature 
of such models makes them particularly predictive of responses in human patients. Animal models of tumors and cancers 
(e.g., breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, etc.) include both non-recombinant and recombinant 


EP 1 623 990 B1 

46 

5 





















(transgenic) animals. Non-recombinant animal models include, for example, rodent. e.g., murine models. Such models 
can be generated by introducing tumor cells into syngeneic mice using standard techniques, e.g., subcutaneous injection, 
tail vein injection, spleen implantation, intraperitoneal implantation, implantation under the renal capsule, or orthopin 
implantation. e.g., colon cancer cells implanted in colonic tissue. (See, e.g., PCT publication No. WO 97/33551, published 
September 18. 1997). 
[0194] Probably the most often used animal species in oncological studies are immunodeficient mice and, in particular, 
nude mice. The observation that the nude mouse with hypo/aplasia could successfully act as a host for human tumor 
xenografts has lead to its widespread use for this purpose. The autosomal recessive nu gene has been introduced into 
a very large number of distinct congenic strains of nude mouse, including, for example, ASW. A/He, AKR, BALB/c, 
B10LP, C17, C3H, C57BL, C57, CBA, DDD, I/st, NC, NFR, NFS, NFS/N, NZB, NZC, NZW. P, RIII and SJL. In addition, 
a wide variety of other animals with inherited immunological defects other than the nude mouse have been bred and 
used as recipients of tumor xenografts. For further details see, e.g., The Nude Mouse in Oncology Research, E. Boven 
and B. Winograd, eds., CRC Press, Inc., 1991. 
[0195] The cells introduced into such animals can be derived from known tumor/cancer cell lines, such as, any of the 
above-listed tumor cell lines, and, for example, the B 104-1-1 ceU line (stable NIH-3T3 cell line transfected with the neu 
protooncogene); ras-transfected NIH-3T3 cells; Caco-2 (ATCC HTB-37); a moderately well-differentiated grade II human 
colon adenocarcinoma cell line. HT-29 (ATCC HTB-38), or from tumors and cancers. Samples of tumor or cancer cells 
can be obtained from patients undergoing surgery, using standard conditions, involving freezing and storing in liquid 
nitrogen (Karmali et al., Br. J. Cancer, 48:689-696 [1983]). 
[0196] Tumor cells can be introduced into animals, such as nude mice, by a variety of procedures. The subcutaneous 
(s.c.) space in mice is very suitable for tumor implantation. Tumors can be transplanted s.c. as solid blocks, as needle 
biopsies by use of a trochar, or as cell suspensions. For solid block or trochar implantation, tumor tissue fragments of 
suitable size are introduced into the s.c. space. Cell suspensions are freshly prepared from primary tumors or stable 
tumor cell lines, and injected subcutaneously. Tumor cells can also be injected as subdermal implants. In this location, 
the inoculum is deposited between the lower part of the dermal connective tissue and the s.c. tissue. Boven and Winograd 
(1991), supra. 
[0197] Animal models of breast cancer can be generated, for example, by implanting rat neuroblastoma cells (from 
which the neu oncogen was initially isolated), or neu-transformed NIH-3T3 cells into nude mice, essentially as described 
by Drebin et al., PNAS USA. 83:9129-9133 (1986). 
[0198] Similarly, animal models of colon cancer can be generated by passaging colon cancer cells in animals, e.g., 
nude mice, leading to the appearance of tumors in these animals. An orthotopic transplant model of human colon cancer 
in nude mice has been described, for example, by Wang et al., Cancer Research, 54:4726-4728 (1994) and Too et al., 
Cancer Research, 55:681-684 (1995). This model is based on the so-called "METAMOUSE" sold by AntiCancer, Inc., 
(San Diego, California). 
[0199] Tumors that arise in animals can be removed and cultured in vitro. Cells from the in vitro cultures can then be 
passaged to animals. Such tumors can serve as targets for further testing or drug screening. Alternatively, the tumors 
resulting from the passage can be isolated and RNA from pre-passage cells and cells isolated after one or more rounds 
of passage analyzed for differential expression of genes of interest. Such passaging techniques can be performed with 
any known tumor or cancer cell lines. 
[0200] For example, Meth A. CMS4, CMS5. CMS21, and WEHI-164 are chemically induced fibrosarcomas of BALB/c 
female mice (DeLeo et al., J. Exp. Med., 146:720 [1977]). which provide a highly controllable model system for studying 
the anti-tumor activities of various agents (Palladino et at, J. Immunol, 138:4023-4032 [1987]). Briefly, tumor cells are 
propagated in vitro in cell culture. Prior to injection into the animals, the cell lines are washed and suspended in buffer, 
at a cell density of about 10x10 6 to 10x10 7 cells/ml. The animals are then infected subcutaneously with 10 to 100 ml of 
the cell suspension, allowing one to three weeks for a tumor to appear. 
[0201] In addition, the Lewis lung (3LL) carcinoma of mice, which is one of the most thoroughly studied experimental 
tumors, can be used as an investigational tumor model. Efficacy in this tumor model has been correlated with beneficial 
effects in the treatment of human patients diagnosed with small cell carcinoma of the lung (SCCL). This tumor can be 
introduced in normal mice upon injection of tumor fragments from an affected mouse or of cells maintained in culture 
(Zupi et al., Br. J. Cancer, 41:suppl. 4:309 [1980]), and evidence indicates that tumors can be started from injection of 
even a single cell and that a very high proportion of infected tumor cells survive. For further information about this tumor 
model see, Zacharski, Haemostasis, 16:300-320 (1986]). 
[0202] One way of evaluating the efficacy of a test compound in an animal model on an implanted tumor is to measure 
the size of the tumor before and after treatment. Traditionally, the size of implanted tumors has been measured with a 
slide caliper in two or three dimensions. The measure limited to two dimensions does not accurately reflect the size of 
the tumor, therefore, it is usually converted into the corresponding volume by using a mathematical formula. However, 
the measurement of tumor size is very inaccurate. The therapeutic effects of a drug candidate can be better described 
as treatment-induced growth delay and specific growth delay. Another important variable in the description of tumor 


EP 1 623 990 B1 

47 

5 





















growth is the tumor volume doubling time. Computer programs for the calculation and description of tumor growth are 
also available, such as the program reported by Rygaard and Spang-Thomsen, Proc. 6th Int. Workshop on Immune-
Deficient Animals, Wu and Sheng eds., BaseL 1989, 301. It is noted, however, that necrosis and inflammatory responses 
following treatment may actually result in an increase in tumor size, at least initially. Therefore, these changes need to 
be carefully monitored, by a combination of a morphometric method and flow cytometric analysis. 
[0203] Recombinant (transgenic) animal models can be engineered by introducing the coding portion of the genes 
identified herein into the genome of animals of interest, using standard techniques for producing transgenic animals. 
Animals that can serve as a target for transgenic manipulation include, without limitation, mice, rats, rabbits, guinea 
pigs, sheep, goats, pigs, and non-human primates, e.g., baboons, chimpanzees and monkeys. Techniques known in 
the art to introduce a transgene into such animals include pronucleic microinjection (Hoppe and Wanger. U.S. Patent 
No. 4,873,191); retrovirus-mediated gene transfer into germ lines (e.g., Van der Putten et al., Proc. Natl. Acad, Sci. 
USA. 82:6148-615 [1985]); gene targeting in embryonic stem cells (Thompson et al., Cell, 56:313-321 [1989]); electro-
poration of embryos (Lo, Mol, Cell Biol., 3:1803-1814 [1983]); sperm-mediated gene transfer (Lavitrano et al., Cell, 57: 
717-73 [1989]). For review, see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,736,866. 
[0204] For the purpose of the present invention, transgenic animals include those that carry the transgene only in part 
of their cells ("mosaic animals"). The transgene can be integrated either as a single transgene, or in concatamers, e.g., 
head-to-head or head-to-tail tandems. Selective introduction of a transgene into a particular cell type is also possible 
by following, for example, the technique of Lasko et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89:6232-636 (1992). 
[0205] The expression of the transgene in transgenic animals can be monitored by standard techniques. For example. 
Southern blot analysis or PCR amplification can be used to verify the integration of the transgene. The level of mRNA 
expression can then be analyzed using techniques such as in situ hybridization. Northern blot analysis, PCR, or immu-
nocytochemistry. The animals are further examined for signs of tumor or cancer development. 
[0206] Alternatively, "knock out" animals can be constructed which have a defective or altered gene encoding a 
PRO7133 polypeptide identified herein, as a result of homologous recombination between the endogenous gene en-
coding the polypeptide and altered genomic DNA encoding the same polypeptide introduced into an embryonic cell of 
the animal. For example, cDNA encoding a PRO7133 polypeptide can be used to clone genomic DNA encoding that 
polypeptide in accordance with established techniques. A portion of the genomic DNA encoding a particular PRO7133 
polypeptide can be deleted or replaced with another gene, such as a gene encoding a selectable marker which can be 
used to monitor integration. Typically, several kilobases of unaltered flanking DNA (both at the 5' and 3' ends) are 
included in the vector [see, e.g., Thomas and Capecchi, Cell, 51:503 (1987) for a description of homologous recombination 
vectors]. The vector is introduced into an embryonic stem cell line (e.g., by electroporation) and cells in which the 
introduced DNA has homologously recombined with the endogenous DNA are selected [see, e.g., Li et al., Cell, 69:915 
(1992)]. The selected cells are then injected into a blastocyst of an animal (e.g., a mouse or rat) to form aggregation 
chimeras [see, e.g., Bradley, in Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach, E. J. Robertson, 
ed. (IRL, Oxford. 1987), pp. 113-152]. A chimeric embryo can then be implanted into a suitable pseudopregnant female 
foster animal and the embryo brought to term to create a "knock out" animal. Progeny harboring the homologously 
recombined DNA in their germ cells can be identified by standard techniques and used to breed animals in which all 
cells of the animal contain the homologously recombined DNA. Knockout animals can be characterized for instance, by 
their ability to defend against certain pathological conditions and by their development of pathological conditions due to 
absence of the PRO7133 polypeptide. 
[0207] The efficacy of antibodies specifically binding the polypeptides identified herein and other drug candidates, 
can be tested also in the treatment of spontaneous animal tumors. A suitable target for such studies is the feline oral 
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Feline oral SCC is a highly invasive, malignant tumor that is the most common oral 
malignancy of cats, accounting for over 60% of the oral tumors reported in this species. It rarely metastasizes to distant 
sites, although this low incidence of metastasis may merely be a reflection of the short survival times for cats with this 
tumor. These tumors are usually not amenable to surgery, primarily because of the anatomy of the feline oral cavity. At 
present, there is no effective treatment for this tumor. Prior to entry into the study, each cat undergoes complete clinical 
examination, biopsy, and is scanned by computed tomography (CT). Cats diagnosed with sublingual oral squamous 
cell tumors are excluded from the study. The tongue can become paralyzed as a result of such tumor, and even if the 
treatment kills the tumor, the animals may not be able to feed themselves. Each cat is treated repeatedly, over a longer 
period of time. Photographs of the tumors will be taken daily during the treatment period, and at each subsequent 
recheck. After treatment, each cat undergoes another CT scan. CT scans and thoracic radiograms are evaluated every 
8 weeks thereafter. The data are evaluated for differences in survival, response and toxicity as compared to control 
groups. Positive response may require evidence of tumor regression, preferably with improvement of quality of life and/or 
increased life span. 
[0208] In addition, other spontaneous animal tumors, such as fibrosarcoma, adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, chrondroma, 
leiomyosarcoma of dogs, cats, and baboons can also be tested. Of these mammary adenocarcinoma in dogs and cats 
is a preferred model as its appearance and behavior are very similar to those in humans. However, the use of this model

is limited by the rare occurrence of this type of tumor in animals. 

K. Screening Assays for Drug Candidates 

[0209] Screening assays for drug candidates are designed to identify compounds that bind or complex with the polypep-
tides encoded by the genes identified herein, or otherwise interfere with the interaction of the encoded polypeptides with 
other cellular proteins. Such screening assays will include assays amenable to high-throughput screening of chemical 
libraries, making them particularly suitable for identifying small molecule drug candidates. Small molecules contemplated 
include synthetic organic or inorganic compounds, including peptides, preferably soluble peptides,(poly)peptide-immu-
noglobulin fusions, and, in particular, antibodies including, without limitation, poly-and monoclonal antibodies and an-
tibody fragments, singte-chain antibodies, anti-idiotypic antibodies, and chimeric or humanized versions of such anti-
bodies or fragments, as well as human antibodies and antibody fragments. The assays can be performed in a variety 
of formats, including protein-protein binding assays, biochemical screening assays, immunoassays and cell based 
assays, which are well characterized in the art. 
[0210] All assays are common in that they call for contacting the drug candidate with a polypeptide encoded by a 
nucleic acid identified herein under conditions and for a time sufficient to allow these two components to interact. 
[0211] In binding assays, the interaction is binding and the complex formed can be isolated or detected in the reaction 
mixture. In a particular embodiment, the polypeptide encoded by the gene identified herein or the drug candidate is 
immobilized on a solid phase, e.g., on a microtiter plate, by covalent or non-covalent attachments. Non-covalent attach-
ment generally is accomplished by coating the solid surface with a solution of the polypeptide and drying. Alternatively, 
an immobilized antibody, e.g., a monoclonal antibody, specific for the polypeptide to be immobilized can be used to 
anchor it to a solid surface. The assay is performed by adding the non-immobilized component, which may be labeled 
by a delectable label, to the immobilized component. e.g., the coated surface containing the anchored component. When 
the reaction is complete, the non-reacted components are removed, e.g., by washing, and complexes anchored on the 
solid surface are detected. When the originally non-immobilized component carries a detectable label, the detection of 
label immobilized on the surface indicates that complexing occurred. Where the originally non-immobilized component 
does not carry a label, complexing can be detected, for example, by using a labeled antibody specifically binding the 
immobilized complex. 
[0212] If the candidate compound interacts with but does not bind to a particular PRO7133 polypeptide encoded by 
a gene identified herein, its interaction with that polypeptide can be assayed by methods well known for detecting protein-
protein interactions. Such assays include traditional approaches, such as, cross-linking, co-immunoprecipitation, and 
co-purification through gradients or chromatographic columns. In addition, protein-protein interactions can be monitored 
by using a yeast-based genetic system described by Fields and co-workers (Fields and Song, Nature, 340:245-246 
(1989); Chien et al., Proc, Natl, Acad. Sci. USA, 88: 9578-9582 (1991)] as disclosed by Chevray and Nathans, Proc, 
Natl, Acad. Sci. USA, 89:5789-5793 (1991)]. Many transcriptional activators, such as yeast GAL4, consist of two physically 
discrete modular domains, one acting as the DNA-binding domain, while the other one functioning as the transcription 
activation domain. The yeast expression system described in the foregoing publications (generally referred to as the 
"two-hybrid system") takes advantage of this property, and employs two hybrid proteins, one in which the target protein 
is fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4, and another, in which candidate activating proteins are fused to the 
activation domain. The expression of a GALI-lacZ reporter gene under control of a GAL4-activated promoter depends 
on reconstitution of GAL4 activity via protein-protein interaction. Colonies containing interacting polypeptides are detected 
with a chromogenic substrate for β-galactosidase. A complete kit (MATCHMAKER ™ ) for identifying protein-protein 
interactions between two specific proteins using the two-hybrid technique is commercially available from Clontech. This 
system can also be extended to map protein domains involved in specific protein interactions as well as to pinpoint 
amino acid residues that are crucial for these interactions. 
[0213] Compounds that interfere with the interaction of a PRO7133 gene identified herein and other intra-or extra-
cellular components can be tested as follows: usually a reaction mixture is prepared containing the product of the 
amplified gene and the intra-or extracellular component under conditions and for a time allowing for the interaction and 
binding of the two products. To test the ability of a test compound to inhibit binding, the reaction is run in the absence 
and in the presence of the test compound. In addition, a placebo may be added to a third reaction mixture, to serve as 
positive control. The binding (complex formation) between the test compound and the intra-or extracellular component 
present in the mixture is monitored as described hereinabove. The formation of a complex in the control reaction(s) but 
not in the reaction mixture containing the test compound indicates that the test compound interferes with the interaction 
of the test compound and its reaction partner. 
[0214] To assay for antagonists, the PRO7133 polypeptide may be added to a cell along with the compound to be 
screened for a particular activity and the ability of the compound to inhibit the activity of interest in the presence of the 
PRO7133 polypeptide indicates that the compound is an antagonist to the PRO7133 polypeptide. Alternatively, antag-
onists may be detected by combining the PRO7133 polypeptide and a potential antagonist with membrane-bound 


EP 1 623 990 B1 

49 

5 





















PRO7133 polypeptide receptors or recombinant receptors under appropriate conditions for a competitive inhibition 
assay. The PRO7133 polypeptide can be labeled, such as by radioactivity, such that the number of PRO7133 polypeptide 
molecules bound to the receptor can be used to determine the effectiveness of the potential antagonist. The gene 
encoding the receptor can be identified by numerous methods known to those of skill in the art, for example, ligand 
panning and FACS sorting. Coligan et al., Current Protocols in Immun., 1(2): Chapter 5 (1991). Preferably, expression 
cloning is employed wherein polyadenylated RNA is prepared from a cell responsive to the PRO7133 polypeptide and 
a cDNA library created from this RNA is divided into pools and used to transfect COS cells or other cells that are not 
responsive to the PRO7133 polypeptide. Transfected cells that are grown on glass slides are exposed to labeled 
PRO7133 polypeptide. The PRO7133 polypeptide can be labeled by a variety of means including iodination or inclusion 
of a recognition site for a site-specific protein kinase. Following fixation and incubation, the slides are subjected to 
autoradiographic analysis. Positive pools are identified and sub-pools are prepared and re-transfected using an inter-
active sub-pooling and re-screening process, eventually yielding a single clone that encodes the putative receptor. 
[0215] As an alternative approach for receptor identification, labeled PRO7133 polypeptide can be photoaffinity-linked 
with cell membrane or extract preparations that express the receptor molecule. Cross-linked material is resolved by 
PAGE and exposed to X-ray film. The labeled complex containing the receptor can be excised, resolved into peptide 
fragments, and subjected to protein micro-sequencing. The amino acid sequence obtained from micro-sequencing would 
be used to design a set of degenerate oligonucleotide probes to screen a cDNA library to identify the gene encoding 
the putative receptor. 
[0216] In another assay for antagonists, mammalian cells or a membrane preparation expressing the receptor would 
be incubated with labeled PRO7133 polypeptide in the presence of the candidate compound. The ability of the compound 
to enhance or block this interaction could then be measured. 
[0217] More specific examples of potential antagonists include an oligonucleotide that binds to the fusions of immu-
noglobulin with the PRO7133 polypeptide, and, in particular, antibodies including, without limitation, poly-and monoclonal 
antibodies and antibody fragments, single-chain antibodies, anti-idiotypic antibodies, and chimeric or humanized versions 
of such antibodies or fragments, as well as human antibodies and antibody fragments. Alternatively, a potential antagonist 
may be a closely related protein, for example, a mutated form of the PRO7133 polypeptide that recognizes the receptor 
but imparts no effect, thereby competitively inhibiting the action of the PRO7133 polypeptide. 
[0218] Another potential PRO7133 polypeptide antagonist is an antisense RNA or DNA construct prepared using 
antisense technology, where, e.g., an antisense RNA or DNA molecule acts to block directly the translation of mRNA 
by hybridizing to targeted mRNA and preventing protein translation. Antisense technology can be used to control gene 
expression through triple-helix formation or antisense DNA or RNA, both of which methods are based on binding of a 
polynucleotide to DNA or RNA. For example, the 5' coding portion of the polynucleotide sequence, which encodes the 
mature PRO7133 polypeptide herein, is used to design an antisense RNA oligonucleotide of from about 10 to 40 base 
pairs in length. A DNA oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to a region of the gene involved in transcription 
(triple helix -see, Lee et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 6:3073 (1979); Cooney et al., Science, 241: 456 (1988); Dervan et al., 
Science, 251:1360 (1991)), thereby preventing transcription and the production of the PRO7133 polypeptide. The an-
tisense RNA oligonucleotide hybridizes to the mRNA in vivo and blocks translation of the mRNA molecule into the 
PRO7133 polypeptide (antisense -Okano, Neurochem., 56:560 (1991); Oligodeoxynucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors 
of Gene Expression (CRC Press: Boca Raton, FL, 1988). The oligonucleotides described above can also be delivered 
to cells such that the antisense RNA or DNA may be expressed in vivo to inhibit production of the PRO7133 polypeptide. 
When antisense DNA is used, oligodeoxyribonucleotides derived from the translation-initiation site, e.g., between about 
-10 and +10 positions of the target gene nucleotide sequence, are preferred. 
[0219] Antisense RNA or DNA molecules are generally at least about 5 bases in length, about 10 bases in length, 
about 15 bases in length, about 20 bases in length, about 25 bases in length, about 30 bases in length, about 35 bases 
in length, about 40 bases in length, about 45 bases in length, about 50 bases in length, about 55 bases in length, about 
60 bases in length, about 65 bases in length, about 70 bases in length, about 75 bases in length, about 80 bases in 
length, about 85 bases in length, about 90 bases in length, about 95 bases in length, about 100 bases in length, or more. 
[0220] Potential antagonists include small molecules that bind to the active site, the receptor binding site, or growth 
factor or other relevant binding site of the PRO7133 polypeptide, thereby blocking the normal biological activity of the 
PRO7133 polypeptide. Examples of small molecules include, but are not limited to, small peptides or peptide-like mol-
ecules, preferably soluble peptides, and synthetic non-peptidyl organic or inorganic compounds. 
[0221] Ribozymes are enzymatic RNA molecules capable of catalyzing the specific cleavage of RNA. Ribozymes act 
by sequence-specific hybridization to the complementary target RNA, followed by endonucleolylic cleavage. Specific 
ribozyme cleavage sites within a potential RNA target can be identified by known techniques. For further details see. 
e.g., Rossi. Current Biology, 4:469-471 (1994), and PCT publication No. WO 97/33551 (published September 18, 1997). 
[0222] Nucleic acid molecules in triple-helix formation used to inhibit transcription should be single-stranded and 
composed of deoxynucleotides. The base composition of theseoligonucleotides is designed such that it promotes triple-
helix formation via Hoogsteen base-pairing rules, which generally require sizeable stretches of purines or pyrimidines

[0223] These small molecules can be identified by any one or more of the screening assays discussed hereinabove 
and/or by any other screening techniques well known for those skilled in the art. 

L. Compositions and Methods for the Treatment of Tumors 

[0224] The compositions useful in the treatment of tumors associated with the amplification of the genes identified 
herein include, without limitation, antibodies, small organic and inorganic molecules, peptides, phosphopeptides, anti-
sense and ribozyme molecules, triple helix molecules, etc., that inhibit the expression and/or activity of the target gene 
product. 
[0225] For example, antisense RNA and RNA molecules act to directly block the translation of mRNA by hybridizing 
to targeted mRNA and preventing protein translation. When antisense DNA is used, oligodeoxyribonucleotides derived 
from the translation initiation site, e.g., between about -10 and +10 positions of the target gene nucleotide sequence, 
are preferred. 
[0226] Ribozymes are enzymatic RNA molecules capable of catalyzing the specific cleavage of RNA. Ribozymes act 
by sequence-specific hybridization to the complementary target RNA, followed by endonucleolytic cleavage. Specific 
ribozyme cleavage sites within a potential RNA target can be identified by known techniques. For further details see, 
e.g., Rossi, Current Biology, 4:469-471 (1994), and PCT publication No. WO 97/33551 (published September 18, 1997). 
[0227] Nucleic acid molecules in triple helix formation used to inhibit transcription should be single-stranded and 
composed of deoxynucleotides. The base composition of these oligonucleotides is designed such that it promotes triple 
helix formation via Hoogsteen base pairing rules, which generally require sizeable stretches of purines or pyrimidines 
on one strand of a duplex. For further details see, e.g., PCT publication No. WO 97/33551, supra. 
[0228] These molecules can be identified by any or any combination of the screening assays discussed hereinabove 
and/or by any other screening techniques well known for those skilled in the art. 

M. Antibodies 

[0229] Some of the most promising drug candidates according to the present invention are antibodies and antibody 
fragments which may inhibit the production or the gene product of the amplified genes identified herein and/or reduce 
the activity of the gene products. 

1. Polyclonal Antibodies 

[0230] Methods of preparing polyclonal antibodies are known to the skilled artisan. Polyclonal antibodies can be raised 
in a mammal, for example, by one or more injections of an immunizing agent and, if desired, an adjuvant. Typically, the 
immunizing agent and/or adjuvant will be injected in the mammal by multiple subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections. 
The immunizing agent may include the PRO7133 polypeptide or a fusion protein thereof. It may be useful to conjugate 
the immunizing agent to a protein known to be immunogenic in the mammal being immunized. Examples of such 
immunogenic proteins include but are not limited to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, serum albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, 
and soybean trypsin inhibitor. Examples of adjuvants which may be employed include Freund's complete adjuvant and 
MPL-TDM adjuvant(monophosphoryl Lipid A. synthetic trehalose dicorynomycolate). The immunization protocol may 
be selected by one skilled in the art without undue experimentation. 

2. Monoclonal Antibodies 

[0231] The anti-PRO7133 antibodies may, alternatively, be monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies may be 
prepared using hybridoma methods, such as those described by Kohler and Milstein, Nature, 256:495 (1975). In a 
hybridoma method, a mouse, hamster, or other appropriate bost animal, is typically immunized with an immunizing agent 
to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the immunizing 
agent. Alternatively, the lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. 
[0232] The immunizing agent will typically include the PRO7133 polypeptide, including fragments, or a fusion protein 
of such protein or a fragment thereof. Generally, either peripheral blood lymphocytes ("PBLs") are used if cells of human 
origin are desired, or spleen cells or lymph node cells are used if non-human mammalian sources are desired. The 
lymphocytes are then fused with an immortalized cell line using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to 
form a hybridoma cell [Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, Academic Press, (1986) pp. 59-103]. 
Immortalized cell lines are usually transformed mammalian cells, particularly myeloma cells of rodent, bovine and human 
origin. Usually, rat or mouse myeloma cell lines are employed. The hybridoma cells may be cultured in a suitable culture 
medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, immortalized 


EP 1 623 990 B1 

51 

5 





















cells. For example, if the parental cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or 
HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine ("HAT 
medium"), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells. 
[0233] Preferred immortalized cell lines are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high level expression of antibody 
by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium More preferred immor-
talized cell lines are murine myeloma lines, which can be obtained, for instance, from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution 
Center. San Diego, California and the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Manassas, Virginia. Human myeloma 
and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies 
[Kozbor, J, Immunol., 133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications. 
Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, (1987) pp. 51-63]. 
[0234] The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can then be assayed for the presence of mon-
oclonal antibodies directed against PRO7133. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by 
the hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay 
(RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Such techniques and assays are known in the art. The binding 
affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson and Pollard, 
Anal. Biochem. 107:220 (1980). 
[0235] After the desired hybridoma cells are identified, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures 
and grown by standard methods [Goding, supra]. Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, Dulbecco's 
Modified Eagle's Medium and RPMI-1640 medium. Alternatively, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites 
in a mammal. 
[0236] The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones may be isolated or purified from the culture medium or 
ascites fluid by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hy-
droxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography. 
[0237] The monoclonal antibodies may also be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those described in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,816,567. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be readily isolated and sequenced 
using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes 
encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells of the invention serve as a preferred 
source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into 
host cells such as simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce 
immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. The DNA also 
may be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant domains 
in place of the homologous murine sequences [U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567; Morrison et al., supra] or by covalently joining 
to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. Such 
a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide can be substituted for the constant domains of an antibody of the invention, or can 
be substituted for the variable domains of one antigen-combining site of an antibody of the invention to create a chimeric 
bivalent antibody. 
[0238] The antibodies may be monovalent antibodies. Methods for preparing monovalent antibodies are well known 
in the art. For example, one method involves recombinant expression of immunoglobulin light chain and modified heavy 
chain. The heavy chain is truncated generally at any point in the Fc region so as to prevent heavy chain crosslinking. 
Alternatively, the relevant cysteine residues are substituted with another amino acid residue or are deleted so as to 
prevent crosslinking. 
[0239] In vitro methods are also suitable for preparing monovalent antibodies. Digestion of antibodies to produce 
fragments thereof, particularly. Fab fragments, can be accomplished using routine techniques known in the art. 

3. Human and Humanized Antibodies 

[0240] The PRO7133 antibodies may further comprise humanized antibodies or human antibodies. Humanized forms 
of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof 
(such as Fv, Fab. Fab'. F(ab') 2 or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) which contain minimal sequence 
derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Humanized antibodies include human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) 
in which residues from a complementary determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR 
of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity and capacity. 
In some instances. Fv framework residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human 
residues. Humanized antibodies may also comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in 
the imported CDR or framework sequences. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least 
one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a 
non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus 
sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region 


EP 1 623 990 B1

(Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin [Jones et al., Nature, 321:322-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature, 
332:323-329 (1988); and Presta, Curr, Op, Struct, Biol., 2:593-596 (1992)]. 
[0241] Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are well known in the art. Generally, a humanized antibody 
has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino 
acid residues are often referred to as "import" residues, which are typically taken from an "import" variable domain. 
Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers [Jones et al., Nature. 321: 
522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-327 (1988); Verboeyen et al., Science, 239:1534-1536 (1988)], by 
substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such 
"humanized" antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567), wherein substantially less than an intact 
human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, 
humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are 
substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies. 
[0242] Human antibodies can also be produced using various techniques known in the art, including phage display 
libraries [Hoogenboom and Winter, J.Mol.Biol., 227:381 (1991); Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222:581 (1991)]. The techniques 
of Cole et al., and Boerner et al., are also available for the preparation of human monoclonal antibodies (Cole et al., 
Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, p. 77 (1985) and Boerner et al., J. Immunol., 147(1):86-95 
(1991)]. Similarly, human antibodies can be made by introducing or human immunoglobulin loci into transgenic animals, 
e.g., mice in which the endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been partially or completely inactivated. Upon challenge, 
human antibody production is observed, which closely resembles that seen in humans in all respects, including gene 
rearrangement, assembly, and antibody repertoire. This approach is described, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 
5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,661,016, and in the following scientific publications: Marks 
et al., Bio/Technology, 10:779-783 (1992); Lonberg et al., Nature, 368:856-859 (1994); Morrison, Nature, 368:812-13 
(1994); Fishwild et al., Nature Biotechnology, 14:845-51 (1996); Neuberger, Nature Biotechnology, 14:826 (1996); 
Lonberg and Huszar, Intern. Rev. Immunol., 13:65-93 (1995). 

4. Antibody Dependent Enzyme Mediated Prodrug Therapy (ADEPT) 

[0243] The antibodies of the present invention may also be used in ADEPT by conjugating the antibody to a prodrug-
activating enzyme which converts a prodrug (e.g., a peptidyl chemotherapeutic agent, see WO 81/01145) to an active 
anti-cancer drug. See, for example, WO 88/07378 and U. S. Patent No. 4,975,278. 
[0244] The enzyme component of the immunoconjugate useful for ADEPT includes any enzyme capable of acting on 
a prodrug in such as way so as to convert it into its more active, cytotoxic form. 
[0245] Enzymes that are useful in the method of this invention include, but are not limited to, glycosidase, glucose 
oxidase, human lysosyme, human glucuronidase, alkaline phosphatase useful for converting phosphate-containing 
prodrugs into free drugs; arylsulfatase useful for converting sulfate-containing prodrugs into free drugs; cytosine deam-
inase useful for converting non-toxic 5-nuorocytosine into the anti-cancer drug 5-fluorouracil; proteases, such as serratia 
protease, thermolysin, subtilisin, carboxypeptidases (e.g., carboxypeptidase G2 and carboxypeptidase A) and cathepsins 
(such as cathepsins B and L), that are useful for converting peptide-containing prodrugs into free drugs; D-alanylcar-
boxypeptidases, useful for converting prodrugs that contain D-amino acid substituents; carbohydrate-cleaving enzymes 
such as β-galactosidase and neuraminidase useful for converting glycosylated prodrugs into free drugs; β-lactamase 
useful for converting drugs derivatized with β-lactams into free drugs; and penicillin amidases, such as penicillin Vamidase 
or penicillin G amidase, useful for converting drugs derivatized at their amine nitrogens with phenoxyacetyl or phenylacetyl 
groups, respectively, into free drugs. Alternatively, antibodies with enzymatic activity, also known in the art as "abzymes" 
can be used to convert the prodrugs of the invention into free active drugs (see, e.g., Massey, Nature, 328:457-458 
(1987)). Antibody-abzyme conjugates can be prepared as described herein for delivery of the abzyme to a tumor cell 
population. 
[0246] The enzymes of this invention can be covalently bound to the anti-PRO7133 antibodies by techniques well 
known in the art such as the use of the heterobifunctional cross-linking agents discussed above. Alternatively, fusion 
proteins comprising at least the antigen binding region of the antibody of the invention linked to at least a functionally 
active portion of an enzyme of the invention can be constructed using recombinant DNA techniques well known in the 
art (see. e.g., Neuberger et aL. Nature. 312:604-608 (1984)). 

5. Bispecific Antibodies 

[0247] Bispecific antibodies are monoclonal, preferably human or humanized, antibodies that have binding specificities 
for at least two different antigens. In the present case, one of the binding specificities is for the PRO7133 the other one 
is for any other antigen, and preferably for a cell-surface protein or receptor or receptor subunit. 
[0248] Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally, the recombinant production of 


EP 1 623 990 B1 

53 

5 





















bispecific antibodies is based on the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy-chain/tight-chain pairs, where the two 
heavy chains have different specificities (Milstein and Cuello, Nature. 305:537-539 [1983]). Because of the random 
assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 
ten different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct 
molecule is usually accomplished by affinity chromatography steps. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93/08829, 
published 13 May 1993, and in Traunecker et al., EMBO J., 10:3655-3659 (1991). 
[0249] Antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) can be 
fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy-chain 
constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge. CH2, and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy-
chain constant region (CH1) containing the site necessary for light-chain binding present in at least one of the fusions. 
DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy-chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted 
into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. For further details of generating 
bispecific antibodies see, for example, Suresh et al., Methods in Enzymology, 121:210(1986). 
[0250] According to another approach described in WO 96/27011, the interface between a pair of antibody molecules 
can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The 
preferred interface comprises at least a part of the CH3 region of an antibody constant domain. In this method, one or 
more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains 
(e.g., tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory "cavities" of identical or similar size to the large side chain(s) are created 
on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (e.g., 
alanine or threonine). This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end-
products such as homodimers. 
[0251] Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g., F(ab') 2 bispecific 
antibodies). Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have been described in the liter-
ature. For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al., Science, 229:81 (1985) 
describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F(ab') 2 fragments. These fragments 
are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent 
intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab' fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB) deriv-
atives. One of the Fab'-TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab'-thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and 
is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab'-TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific 
antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes. 
[0252] Fab' fragments may be directly recovered from E. coli and chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. 
Shalaby et al., J. Exp. Med., 175:217-225 (1992) describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F(ab') 2 
molecule. Each Fab' fragment was separately secreted from E. coli and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro 
to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the ErbB2 
receptor and normal human T cells, as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human 
breast tumor targets. 
[0253] Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant ceU culture 
have also been described. For example, bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et 
al., J. Immunol., 148(5):1547-1553 (1992). The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to 
the Fab' portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region 
to form monomers and then re-oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the 
production of antibody homodimers. The "diabody" technology described by Hollinger et al., Proc, Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 
90:6444-6448 (1993) has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments 
comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (V H ) connected to a light-chain variable domain (V L ) by a linker which is too 
short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the V H and V L domains of one fragment 
are forced to pair with the complementary V L and V H domains of another fragment, thereby forming two antigen-binding 
sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also 
been reported. See, Gruber et al., J. Immunol., 152:5368 (1994). 
[0254] Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example, trispecific antibodies can be prepared. 
Tutt et al., J. Immunol., 147:60 (1991). 
[0255] Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes on a given polypeptide herein. Alternatively, 
an anti-polypeptide arm may be combined with an arm which binds to a triggering molecule on a leukocyte such as a 
T-cell receptor molecule (e.g., CD2, CD3. CD28, or B7), or Fe receptors for IgG (FcγR), such as FcγRI (CD64). FcγRII 
(CD32) and FcγRIII (CD16) so as to focus cellular defense mechanisms to the cell expressing the particular polypeptide. 
Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express a particular polypeptide. These 
antibodies possess a polypeptide-binding arm and an arm which binds a cytotoxic agent or a radionuclide chelator, such 
as EOTUBE, DPTA, DOTA, or TETA. Another bispecific antibody of interest binds the polypeptide and further binds 
tissue factor (TF).

6. Heteroconjugate Antibodies 

[0256] Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies. Such antibodies have, for ex-
ample, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells [U.S. Patent No. 4,676,980], and for treatment 
of HIV infection [WO 71/00360; WO 92/200373; EP 03089]. It is contemplated that the antibodies may be prepared in 
vitro using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry, including those involving crosslinking agents. For example, 
immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of 
suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl-4-metcaptobutyrinudate and those disclosed, for 
example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,676,980. 

7. Effector function engineering 

[0257] It may be desirable to modify the antibody of the invention with respect to effector function, so as to enhance 
the effectiveness of the antibody in treating cancer, for example. For example, cysteine residue(s) may be introduced 
in the Fc region, thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus 
generated may have improved internalization capability and/or increased complement-mediated cell killing and antibody-
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). See. Caron el al., J. Exp. Med., 176:1191-1195 (1992) and Shopes, J.Immunol., 
148:2918-2922(1922). Homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti-tumor activity may also be prepared using heterob-
ifunctional cross-linkers as described in Wolff et al., Cancer Research, 53:2560-2565 (1993). Alternatively, an antibody 
can be engineered which has dual Fc regions and may thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. 
See, Stevenson et al., Anti-Cancer Drug Design, 3:219-230 (1989). 

8. Immunoconjugates 

[0258] The invention also pertains to immunoconjugates comprising an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such 
as a chemotherapeutic agent, toxin (e.g., an enzymatically active toxin of bacteria), fungal, plant or animal origin, or 
fragments thereof, or a small molecule toxin), or a radioactive isotope (i.e., a radioconjugate). 
[0259] Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of such immunoconjugates have been described above. 
Enzymatically active protein toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain, nonbinding 
active fragments of diphtheria toxin, cholera toxin, botulinus toxin, exotoxin A chain (from Pseudomonas aeruginosa), 
ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, Aleurites fordii proteins, dianthin proteins, Phytolaca 
americana proteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), momordica charantia inhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria officinalis in-
hibitor, gelonin, saporin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin and the tricothecenes. Small molecule toxins 
include, for example, calicheamicins, maytansinoids, palytoxin and CC1065. A variety of radionuclides are available for 
the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include 212 Bi, 131 I, 131 In, 90 Y and 186 Re. 
[0260] Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents 
such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol) propionate (SPDP), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters 
(such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutaraldehyde), 
bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazo-
niumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as tolyene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds 
(such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et 
al., Science. 238:1098 (1987). Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid 
(MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See, WO94/11026. 
[0261] In another-embodiment,-the antibody-may be-conjugated to a "receptor" (such as streptavidin) for utilization 
in tumor pretargeting wherein the antibody-receptor conjugate is administered to the patient, followed by removal of 
unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a "ligand" (e.g., avidin) which 
is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (e.g., a radionucleotide). 

9. Immunoliposomes 

[0262] The antibodies disclosed herein may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. Liposomes containing the 
antibody are prepared by methods known in the art, such as described in Epstein et al., Proc. Natl, Acad. Sci, USA, 82: 
3688 (1985); Hwang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77:4030 (1980); and U.S. Patent Nos. 4,485,045 and 4,544,545. 
Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5.013.556. 
[0263] Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid compo-
sition comprising phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and PEG-derivatized phosphatidytethanolamine (PEO-PE). Lipo-
somes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. Fab' fragments of 
the antibody of the present invention can be conjugated to the liposomes as described in Martin et al, J. Biol. Chem., 


EP 1 623 990 B1

257:286-288 (1982) via a disulfide interchange reaction. A chemotherapeutic agent (such as Doxorubicin) is optionally 
contained within the liposome. See, Gabizon et al., J. National Cancer Inst., 81(19):1484 (1989). 

N. Pharmaceutical Compositions 

[0264] Antibodies specifically binding the product of an amplified gene identified herein, as well as other molecules 
identified by the screening assays disclosed hereinbefore, can be administered for the treatment of tumors, including 
cancers, in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. 
[0265] If the protein encoded by the amplified gene is intracellular and whole antibodies are used as inhibitors, inter-
nalizing antibodies are preferred. However, lipofections or liposomes can also be used to deliver the antibody, or an 
antibody fragment, into cells. Where antibody fragments are used, the smallest inhibitory fragment which specifically 
binds to the binding domain of the target protein is preferred. For example, based upon the variable region sequences 
of an antibody, peptide molecules can be designed which retain the ability to bind the target protein sequence. Such 
peptides can be synthesized chemically and/or produced by recombinant DNA technology (see, e.g., Marasco et al., 
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:7889-7893 [1993]). 
[0266] Therapeutic formulations of the antibody are prepared for storage by mixing the antibody having the desired 
degree of purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical 
Sciences, 16th edition, Osol, A. ed. [1980]), in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable 
carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include 
buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; pre-
servatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, 
benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; 
resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; 
proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino 
acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other 
carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, man-
nitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); 
and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN ™ , PLURONICS ™ or polyethylene glycol (PEG). 
[0267] Non-antibody compounds identified by the screening assays of the present invention can be formulated in an 
analogous manner, using standard techniques well known in the art. 
[0268] The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular 
indication being treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. Alter-
natively, or in addition, the composition may comprise a cytotoxic agent, cytokine or growth inhibitory agent. Such 
molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. 
[0269] The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation tech-
niques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methyl-
methacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin micro-
spheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in 
Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th edition, Osol, A. ed. (1980). 
[0270] The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration 
through sterile filtration membranes. 
[0271] Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include 
semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped 
articles, e.g., films or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, 
poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-
glutamic acid and ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copol-
ymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT ™ (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and 
leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-
glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. 
When encapsulated antibodies remain in the body for a long time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure 
to moisture at 37˚C, resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies 
can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is 
discovered to be intermolecular S-S bond formation through thio-disulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved 
by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate ad-
ditives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.

O. Methods of Treatment 

[0272] it is contemplated that the antibodies and other anti-tumor compounds of the present invention may be used 
to treat various conditions, including those characterized by overexpression and/or activation of the amplified genes 
identified herein. Exemplary conditions or disorders to be treated with such antibodies and other compounds, including, 
but not limited to, small organic and inorganic molecules, peptides. antisense molecules, etc., include benign or malignant 
tumors (e.g., renal, liver, kidney, bladder, breast, gastric, ovarian, colorectal, prostate, pancreatic, lung, vulval, thyroid, 
hepatic carcinomas; sarcomas; glioblastomas; and various head and neck tumors); leukemias and lymphoid malignan-
cies; other disorders such as neuronal, glial, astrocytal, hypothalamic and other glandular, macrophagal, epithelial, 
stromal and blastocoelic disorders; and inflammatory, angiogenic and immunologic disorders. 
[0273] The anti-tumor agents of the present invention, e.g., antibodies, are administered to a mammal, preferably a 
human, in accord with known methods, such as intravenous administration as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a 
period of time, by intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intracerobrospinal, subcutaneous, intra-articular, intrasynovial, intrath-
ecal, oral, topical, or inhalation routes. Intravenous administration of the antibody is preferred. 
[0274] Other therapeutic regimens may be combined with the administration of the anti-cancer agents, e.g., antibodies 
of the instant invention. For example, the patient to be treated with such anti-cancer agents may also receive radiation 
therapy. Alternatively, or in addition, a chemotherapeutic agent may be administered to the patient Preparation and 
dosing schedules for such chemotherapeutic agents may be used according to manufacturers' instructions or as deter-
mined empirically by the skilled practitioner. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapy are also described 
in Chemotherapy Service Ed., M.C. Perry. Williams &amp; Wilkins, Baltimore. MD (1992). The chemotherapeutic agent may 
precede, or follow administration of the anti-tumor agent. e.g., antibody, or may be given simultaneously therewith. The 
antibody may be combined with an anti-oestrogen compound such as tamoxifen or an anti-progesterone such as ona-
pristone (see, EP 616812) in dosages known for such molecules. 
[0275] It may be desirable to also administer antibodies against other tumor associated antigens, such as antibodies 
which bind to the ErbB2, EGFR, ErbB3. ErbB4, or vascular endothelial factor (VEGF). Alternatively, or in addition, two 
or more antibodies binding the same or two or more different antigens disclosed herein may be co-administered to the 
patient. Sometimes, it may be beneficial to also administer one or more cytokines to the patient. In a preferred embodiment, 
the antibodies herein are co-administered with a growth inhibitory agent. For example, the growth inhibitory agent may 
be administered first, followed by an antibody of the present invention. However, simultaneous administration or admin-
istration of the antibody of the present invention first is also contemplated. Suitable dosages for the growth inhibitory 
agent are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action (synergy) of the growth inhibitory agent 
and the antibody herein. 
[0276] For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of an anti-tumor agent, e.g., an antibody 
herein will depend on the type of disease to be treated, as defined above, the severity and course of the disease, whether 
the agent is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and 
response to the agent, and the discretion of the attending physician. The agent is suitably administered to the patient 
at one time or over a series of treatments. 
[0277] For example, depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 mg/kg to 15 mg/kg (e.g., 0.1-20 mg/kg) 
of antibody is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate 
administrations, or by continuous infusion. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg or more, 
depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on 
the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. However, other dosage 
regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays. 

P. Articles of Manufacture 

[0278] In another embodiment of the invention, an article of manufacture containing materials useful for the diagnosis 
or treatment of the disorders described above is provided. The article of manufacture comprises a container and a label. 
Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, and test tubes. The containers may be formed from a 
variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds a composition which is effective for diagnosing or 
treating the condition and may have a sterile access port (for example the container may be an intravenous solution 
bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). The active agent in the composition is 
usually an anti-tumor agent capable of interfering with the activity of a gene product identified herein, e.g., an antibody. 
The label on, or associated with, the container indicates that the composition is used for diagnosing or treating the 
condition of choice. The article of manufacture may further comprise a second container comprising a pharmaceutically-
acceptable buffer, such as phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may further include 
other materiels desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, 
syringes and package inserts with instructions for use.

Q. Diagnosis and Prognosis of Tumors 

[0279] While cell surface proteins, such as growth receptors overexpressed in certain tumors are excellent targets for 
drug candidates or tumor (e.g., cancer) treatment, the same proteins along with secreted proteins encoded by the genes 
amplified in tumor cells find additional use in the diagnosis and prognosis of tumors. For example: antibodies directed 
against the protein products of genes amplified in-tumor cells can be used as tumor diagnostics or prognostics. 
[0280] For example, antibodies, including antibody fragments, can be used to qualitatively or quantitatively detect the 
expression of proteins encoded by the amplified genes ("marker gene products"). The antibody preferably is equipped 
with a detectable, e.g., fluorescent label, and binding can be monitored by light microscopy, flow cytometry, fluorimetry, 
or other techniques known in the art. These techniques are particularly suitable, if the amplified gene encodes a cell 
surface protein, e.g., a growth factor. Such binding assays are performed essentially as described in section 5 above. 
[0281] In situ detection of antibody binding to the marker gene products can be performed, for example, by immun-
ofluorescence or immunoelectron microscopy. For this purpose, a histological specimen is removed from the patient, 
and a labeled antibody is applied to it, preferably by overlaying the antibody on a biological sample. This procedure also 
allows for determining the distribution of the marker gene product in the tissue examined. It will be apparent for those 
skilled in the art that a wide variety of histological methods are readily available for in situ detection. 
[0282] The following examples are offered for illustrative purposes only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the 
present invention in any way. 
[0283] All patent and literature references cited in the present specification are hereby incorporated by reference in 
their entirety.

EXAMPLE 1 

Extracellular Domain Homology Screening to Identify Novel Polypeptides and cDNA Encoding Therefor 

[0286] The extracellular domain (ECD) sequences (including the secretion signal sequence, if any) from about 950 
known secreted proteins from the Swiss-Prot public database were used to search EST databases. The EST databases 
included public databases (e.g., Dayhoff, GenBank), and proprietary databases (e.g. LUMSEQ*. Incyte Pharmaceuticals, 
Palo Alto. CA). The search was performed using the computer program BLAST or BLAST-2 (Altschul et al., Methods in 
Enzymology, 266:460-480 (1996)) as a comparison of the ECD protein sequences to a 6 frame translation of the EST 
sequences. Those comparisons with a BLAST score of 70 (or in some cases 90) or greater that did not encode known 
proteins were clustered and assembled into consensus DNA sequences with the program "phrap" (Phil Green, University 
of Washington, Seattle, Washington). 
[0287] Using this extracellular domain homology screen, consensus DNA sequences were assembled relative to the 
other identified EST sequences using phrap. In addition, the consensus DNA sequences obtained were often (but not 
always) extended using repeated cycles of BLAST or BLAST-2 and phrap to extend the consensus sequence as far as 


EP 1 623 990 B1

possible using the sources of EST sequences discussed above. 
[0288] Based upon the consensus sequences obtained as described above, oligonucleotides were then synthesized 
and used to identify by PCR a cDNA library that contained the sequence of interest and for use as probes to isolate a 
clone of the full-length coding sequence for a PRO polypeptide. Forward and reverse PCR primers generally range from 
20 to 30 nucleotides and are often designed to give a PCR product of about 100-1000 bp in length. The probe sequences 
are typically 40-55 bp in length. In some cases, additional oligonucleotides are synthesized when the consensus sequence 
is greater than about 1-1.5 kbp. In order to screen several libraries for a full-length clone, DNA from the libraries was 
screened by PCR amplification, as per Ausubel et al, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, with the PCR primer pair. 
A positive library was then used to isolate clones encoding the gene of interest using the probe oligonucleotide and one 
of the primer pairs. 
[0289] The cDNA libraries used to isolate the cDNA clones were constructed by standard methods using commercially 
available reagents such as those from Invitrogen, San Diego, CA. The cDNA was primed with oligo dT containing a NotI 
site, linked with blunt to SalI hemikinased adaptors, cleaved with NotI, sized appropriately by gel electrophoresis, and 
cloned in a defined orientation into a suitable cloning vector (such as pRKB or pRKD; pRK5B is a precursor of pRKSD 
that does not contain the SfiI site; see, Holmes et al., Science, 253:1278-1280 (1991)) in the unique XhoI and NotI sites. 

EXAMPLE 2 

Isolation of cDNA Clones Using Signal Algorithm Analysis 

[0290] Various polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid sequences were identified by applying a proprietary signal sequence 
finding algorithm developed by Genentech, Inc., (South San Francisco, CA) upon ESTs as well as clustered and as-
sembled EST fragments from public (e.g., GenBank) and/or private (LIFESEQ ® , Incyte Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Palo Alto, 
CA) databases. The signal sequence algorithm computes a secretion signal score based on the character of the DNA 
nucleotides surrounding the first and optionally the second methionine codon(s) (ATG) at the 5'-end of the sequence or 
sequence fragment under consideration. The nucleotides following the first ATG must code for at least 35 unambiguous 
amino acids without any stop codons. If the first ATG has the required amino acids, the second is not examined. If 
neither meets the requirement, the candidate sequence is not scored. In order to determine whether the EST sequence 
contains an authentic signal sequence, the DNA and corresponding amino acid sequences surrounding the ATG codon 
are scored using a set of seven sensors (evaluation parameters) known to be associated with secretion signals. Use of 
this algorithm resulted in the identification of numerous polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid sequences. 

EXAMPLE 3 

Isolation of cDNA Clones Encoding a Human PRO7133 

[0291] Clone DNA 128450-2739 was pulled out by a CARD homolog screen, and the sequence was used as a probe 
to isolate a clone of the full-length coding sequence for PR07133 using traditional low stringency and hybridization. To 
identify the full ORF-for the PR07133 cDNA, the CARD domain containing molecule; a cDNA fragment encoding the N-
terminal portion of SOCA-1; was used to screen a human fetal kidney library. Several positive clones were picked up, 
and the DNA was prepared and sequenced.

The probe DNA (soca-l) had the following nucleotide sequence: 

[0292] DNA sequencing revealed that one of the cDNA clones contains a full-length ORF that encodes a protein 
significantly homologous to the human Sab protein: the PRO7133 polypeptide (designated herein as DNA 128451-2739 
[Figure 1, SEQ ID NO:1] and the derived protein sequence for that PRO7133 polypeptide.

[0293] Clone DNA 128451-2739 contains a singleopen reading frame with an apparent translational initiation site at 
nucleotide positions 501-503 and ending at the stop codon at nucleotide positions 1680-1682 (Figure 33). The predicted 
polypeptide precursor is 393 amino acids long (Figure 2: SEQ ID NO:2). The full-length PRO7133 protein shown in 
Figure 2 has an estimated molecular weight of about 43.499 daltons and a p1 of about 5.75. Analysis of the full-length 
PR07133 sequence shown in Figure 2 (SEQ ID NO:2) evidences the presence of a variety of important polypeptide 
domains, wherein the locations given for those important polypeptide domains are approximate as described above. 
Analysis of the full-length PR07133 sequence shown in Figure 2 evidences the presence of the following: cAMP-and 
cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites from about amino acid 287 to about amino acid 291 and from 
about amino acid 375 to about amino acid 379; N-myristoylation sites from about amino acid 37 to about amino acid 
43, from about amino acid 38 to about amino acid 44, from about amino acid 39 to about amino acid 45, from about 
amino acid 40 to about amino acid 46, from about amino acid 103 to about amino acid 109, from about amino acid 307 
to about amino acid 313, from about amino acid 310 to about amino acid 316, from about amino acid 315 to about amino 
acid 321, from about amino acid 365 to about amino acid 371, from about amino acid 369 to about amino acid 375, from 
about amino acid 373 to about amino acid 379. from about amino acid 377 to about amino acid 383, from about amino 
acid 380 to about amino acid 386, and from about amino acid 381 to about amino acid 387; and an amidation site from 
about amino acid 373 to about amino acid 377. Clone DNA128451-2739 has been deposited with ATCC on August 31. 
1999 and is assigned ATCC deposit no. PTA-618. 

EXAMPLE 4 

Gene Amplification 

[0294] This example shows that the PRO7133 genes are amplified in the genome of certain human lung, colon and/or 
breast cancers and/or cell lines. Amplification is associated with overexpression of the gene product, indicating that the 
polypeptides are useful targets for therapeutic intervention in certain cancers such as colon, lung, breast and other 
cancers. Therapeutic agents may take the form of antagonists of PRO7133 polypeptides, for example, murine human 
chimeric, humanized or human antibodies against a PRO7133 polypeptide. 
[0295] The starting material for the screen was genomic DNA isolated from a variety of cancers. The DNA is quantitated 
precisely, e.g., fluorometrically. As a negative control, DNA was isolated from the cells of ten normal healthy individuals 
which was pooled and used as assay controls for the gene copy in healthy individuals (not shown). The 5' nuclease 
assay (for example, TaqMan ™ ) and real-time quantitative PCR (for example, ABI Prizm 7700 Sequence Detection 
System ™ (Perkin Elmer, Applied Biosystems Division, Foster City, CA)), were used to find genes potentially amplified 
in certain cancers. The results were used to determine whether the DNA encoding PRO7133 is over-represented in any 
of the primary lung or colon cancers or cancer cell lines or breast cancer cell lines that were screened. The primary lung 
cancers were obtained from individuals with tumors of the type and stage as indicated in Table 6: An explanation of the 
abbreviations used for the designation of the primary tumors listed in Table 6 and the primary tumors and ceU lines 
referred to throughout this example has been given hereinbefore. 
[0296] The results of the TaqMan ™ are reported in delta (∆) Ct units. One unit corresponds to 1 PCR cycle or approx-
imately a 2-fold amplification relative to normal, two units corresponds to 4-fold. 3 units to 8-fold amplification and so 
on. Quantitation was obtained using primers and a TaqMan™ fluorescent probe derived from the PRO7133 gene. 
Regions of PRO7133 which are most likely to contain unique nucleic acid sequences and which arc least likely to have 
spliced out introns are preferred for the primer and probe derivation, e.g., 3'-untranslated regions. The sequences for 
the primers and probes (forward, reverse and probe) used for the PRO7133 gene amplification analysis were as follows: 

[0297] The 5' nuclease assay reaction is a fluorescent PCR-based technique which makes useof the 5'exonuclease 
activity of Taq DNA polymerase enzyme to monitor amplification in real time. Two oligonucleotide primers are used to 
generate an amplicon typical of a PCR reaction. A third oligonucleotide, or probe, is designed to detect nucleotide 
sequence located between the two PCR primers. The probe is non-extendible by Taq DNA polymerase enzyme, and

is labeled with a reporter fluorescent dye and a quencher fluorescent dye. Any laser-induced emission from the reporter 
dye is quenched by the quenching dye when the two dyes are located close together as they are on the probe. During 
the amplification reaction, the Taq DNA polymerase enzyme cleaves the probe in a template-dependent manner. The 
resultant probe fragments disassociate in solution, and signal from the released reporter dye is free from the quenching 
effect of the second fluorophore. One molecule of reporter dye is liberated for each new molecule synthesized, and 
detection of the unquenched reporter dye provides the basis for quantitative interpretation of the data. 
[0298] The 5' nuclease procedure is run on a real-time quantitative PCR device such as the ABI Prism 7700TM 
Sequence Detection. The system consists of a thermocycler, laser, charge-coupled device (CCD) camera and computer. 
The system amplifies samples in a 96-well format on a thermocycler. During amplification, laser-induced fluorescent 
signal is collected in real-time through fiber optics cables for all 96 wells, and detected at the CCD. The system includes 
software for running the instrument and for analyzing the data. 
[0299] 5' Nuclease assay data are initially expressed as Ct, or the threshold cycle. This is defined as the cycle at 
which the reporter signal accumulates above the background level of fluorescence. The ACt values are used as quan-
titative measurement of the relative number of starting copies of a particular target sequence in a nucleic acid sample 
when comparing cancer DNA results to normal human DNA results.

PRO7133 compounds of the invention.

DNA Preparation: 

[0301] DNA was prepared from cultured cell lines, primary tumors, and normal human blood. The isolation was per-
formed using purification kit, buffer set and protease and all from Qiagen, according to the manufacturer's instructions 
and the description below. 

Cell culture lysis: 

[0302] Cells were washed and trypsinized at a concentration of 7.5 x 10 8 per tip and pelleted by centrifuging at 1000 
rpm for 5 minutes at 4˚C, followed by washing again with 1/2 volume of PBS and recentrifugation. The pellets were 
washed a third time, the suspended cells collected and washed 2x with PBS. The cells were then suspended into 10 
ml PBS. Buffer Cl was equilibrated at 4˚C. Qiagea protease #19155 was diluted into 6.25 ml cold ddH 2 O to a final 
concentration of 20 mg/ml and equilibrated at 4˚C. 10 ml of G2 Buffer was prepared by diluting Qiagen RNAse A stock 
(100 mg/ml) to a final concentration of 200 mg/ml. 
[0303] Buffer Cl(10 ml, 4˚C) and ddH2O (40 ml. 4˚C) were then added to the 10 ml of cell suspension, mixed by 
inverting and incubated on ice for 10 minutes. The cell nuclei were pelleted by centrifuging in a Beckman swinging bucket 
rotor at 2500 rpm at 4˚C for 15 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and the nuclei were suspended with a vortex 
into 2 ml Buffer Cl (at 4˚C) and 6 ml ddH 2 O, followed by a second 4˚C centrifugation at 2500rpm for 15 minutes. The 
nuclei were then resuspended into the residual buffer using 200 ml per tip. G2 buffer (10 ml) was added to the suspended 
nuclei while gentle vortexing was applied. Upon completion of buffer addition, vigorous vortexing was applied for 30 
seconds. Qiagen protease (200 ml, prepared as indicated above) was added and incubated at 50˚C for 60 minutes. The 
incubation and centrifugation were repeated until the lysates were clear (e.g., incubating additional 30-60 minutes, 
pelleting at 3000 x g for 10 min., 4˚C). 

Solid human tumor sample preparation and lysis: 

[0304] Tumor samples were weighed and placed into 50 ml conical tubes and held on ice. Processing was limited to 
no more than 250 mg tissue per preparation (1 tip/preparation). The protease solution was freshly prepared by diluting 
into 6.25 ml cold ddH 2 O to a final concentration of 20 mg/ml and stored at 4˚C. G2 buffer (20 ml) was prepared by diluting 
DNAse A to a final concentration of 200 mg/ml (from 100 mg/ml stock). The tumor tissue was homogenated in 19 ml 
G2 buffer for 60 seconds using the large tip of the polytron in a laminar-flow TC hood in order to avoid inhalation of 
aerosols, and held at room temperature. Between samples, the polytron was cleaned by spinning at 2 x 30 seconds 
each in 2L ddH 2 O, followed by G2 buffer (50 ml). If tissue was still present on the generator tip, the apparatus was 
disassembled and cleaned. 
[0305] Qiagen protease (prepared as indicated above. 1.0 ml) was added, followed by vortexing and incubation at 
50˚C for 3 hours. The incubation and centrifugation were repeated until the lysates were clear (e.g., incubating additional 
30-60 minutes, pelleting at 3000 x g for 10 min., 4˚C). 

Human blood preparation and lysis; 

[0306] Blood was drawn from healthy volunteers using standard infectious agent protocols and citrated into 10 ml 
samples per tip. Qiagen protease was freshly prepared by dilution into 6.25 ml cold ddH 2 O to a final concentration of 
20 mg/ml and stored at 4˚C. G2 buffer was prepared by diluting RNAse A to a final concentration of 200 mg/ml from 100 
mg/ml stock. The blood (10 ml) was placed into a 50 ml conical tube and 10 ml Cl buffer and 30 ml ddH 2 O (both previously 
equilibrated to 4˚C) were added, and the components mixed by inverting and held on ice for 10 minutes. The nuclei 
were pelleted with a Beckman swinging bucket rotor at 2500 rpm, 4˚C for 15 minutes and the supernatant discarded. 
With a vortex, the nuclei were suspended into 2 ml C1 buffer (4˚C) and 6 ml ddH 2 O (4˚C). Vortexing was repeated until 
the pellet was white. The nuclei were then suspended into the residual buffer using a 200 ml tip. G2 buffer (10 ml) was

added to the suspended nuclei while gently vortexing, followed by vigorous vortexing for 30 seconds. Qiagen protease 
was added (200 ml) and incubated at 50˚C for 60 minutes. The incubation and centrifugation were repeated until the 
lysates were clear (e.g., incubating additional 30-60 minutes, pelleting at 3000 x g for 10 min., 4˚C). 

Purification of cleared lysates: 

(1) Isolation of genomic DNA: 

[0307] Genomic DNA was equilibrated (1 sample per maxi tip preparation) with 10 ml QBT buffer. QF elution buffer 
was equilibrated at 50˚C. The samples were vortexed for 30 seconds, then loaded onto equilibrated tips and drained 
by gravity. The tips were washed with 2 x 15 ml QC buffer. The DNA was eluted into 30 ml silanized, autoclaved 30 ml 
Corex tubes with 15 ml QF buffer (50˚C). Isopropanol (10.5 ml) was added to each sample, the tubes covered with 
parafin and mixed by repeated inversion until the DNA precipitated. Samples were pelleted by centrifugation in the SS-
34 rotor at 15,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4˚C. The pellet location was marked, the supernatant discarded, and 10 ml 
70% ethanol (4˚C) was added. Samples were pelleted again by centrifugation on the SS-34 rotor at 10,000 rpm for 10 
minutes at 4˚C. The pellet location was marked and the supernatant discarded. The tubes were then placed on their 
side in a drying rack and dried 10 minutes at 37˚C, taking care not to overdry the samples. 
[0308] After drying, the pellets were dissolved into 1.0 ml TE (pH 8.5) and placed at 50˚C for 1-2 hours. Samples were 
held overnight at 4˚C as dissolution continued. The DNA solution was then transferred to 1.5 ml tubes with a 26 gauge 
needle on a tuberculin syringe. The transfer was repeated 5x in order to shear the DNA. Samples were then placed at 
50˚C for 1-2 hours. 

(2) Quantitation of genomic DNA and preparation for gene amplification assay: 

[0309] The DNA levels in each tube were quantified by standard A 260 / A 280 spectrophotometry on a 1:20 dilution (5 
ml DNA + 95 ml ddH,O) using the 0.1 ml quartz cuvettes in the Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer. A 260 /A 280 ratios 
were in the range of 1.8-1.9. Each DNA sample was then diluted further to approximately 200 ng/ml in TE (pH 8.5). If 
the original material was highly concentrated (about 700 ng/ml), the material was placed at 50˚C for several hours until 
resuspended. 
[0310] Fluorometric DNA quantitation was then performed on the diluted material (20-600 ng/ml) using the manufac-
turer's guidelines as modified below. This was accomplished by allowing a Hoeffer DyNA Quant 200 fluorometer to 
warm-up for about 15 minutes. The Hoechst dye working solution (#H33258, 10 ml, prepared within 12 hours of use) 
was diluted into 100 ml 1 x TNE buffer. A 2 ml cuvette was filled with the fluorometer solution, placed into the machine, 
and the machine was zeroed. pGEM 3Zf(+) (2 ml, lot #360851026) was added to 2 ml of fluorometer solution and 
calibrated at 200 units. An additional 2 ml of pGEM 3Zf(+) DNA was then tested and the reading confirmed at 400 +/-
10 units. Each sample was then read at least in triplicate. When 3 samples were found to be within 10% of each other, 
their average was taken and this value was used as the quantification value, 
[0311] The fluorometricly determined concentration was then used to dilute each sample to 10 ng/ml in ddH 2 O. This 
was done simultaneously on all template samples for a single TaqMan ™ plate assay, and with enough material to run 
500-1000 assays. The samples were tested in triplicate with Taqman ™ primers and probe both B-actin and GAPDH on 
a single plate with normal human DNA and no-template controls. The diluted samples were used provided that the CT 
value of normal human DNA subtracted from test DNA was +/-1 Ct. The diluted, lot-qualified genomic DNA was stored 
in 1.0 ml aliquots at -80˚C. Aliquots which were subsequently to be used in the gene amplification assay were stored at 
4˚C. Each 1 ml aliquot is enough for 8-9 plates or 64 tests. 

Gene amplification assay: 

[0312] The PRO7133 compounds of the invention were screened in the following primary tumors and the resulting 
∆Ct values are reported in Table 7B.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION : 

PRO7133 (DNA128451-2739): 

[0313] The ∆Ct values for DNA 128451-2739 in a variety of tumors are reported in Table 7B. A ∆Ct of &gt;1 was typically 
used as the threshold value for amplification scoring, as this represents a doubling of gene copy. Table 7B indicates 
that significant amplification of nucleic acid DNA128451-2739 encoding PRO7133 occurred: (1) in primary lung tumors: 
HF-000840 and HF-001296; and (2) in primary colon tumor centers: HF-000795 and HF-000811. 
[0314] Because amplification of DMA1284S1-2739 occurs in various tumors, it is highly probable to play a significant 
role in tumor formation or growth. As a result, antagonists (e.g., antibodies) directed against the protein encoded by 
DNA128451-2739 (PRO7133) would be expected to have utility in cancer therapy. 

EXAMPLE 5 

In situ Hybridization 

[0315] In situ hybridization is a powerful and versatile technique for the detection and localization of nucleic acid 
sequences within cell or tissue preparations. It may be useful, for example, to identify sites of gene expression, analyze 
the tissue distribution of transcription, identify and localize viral infection, follow changes in specific mRNA synthesis, 
and aid in chromosome mapping. 
[0316] In situ hybridization was performed following an optimized version of the protocol by Lu and Gillett, Cell Vision, 
1:169-176(1994), using PCR-gencrated 33 P-labeled riboprobes. Briefly, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human tis-
sues were sectioned, deparaffinized, deproteinated in proteinase K (20 g/ml) for 15 minutes at 37˚C, and further processed 
for in situ hybridization as described by Lu and Gillett, supra. A ( 33 -P)UTP-labeted antisense riboprobe was generated 
from a PCR product and hybridized at 55 ˚C overnight The slides were dipped in Kodak NTB2 ™ nuclear track emulsion 
and exposed for 4 weeks. 

33 P-Riboprode synthesis 

[0317] 6.0 ml (125mCl) of 33 P-VTP (Amersham BF 1002, SA&lt;2000 Ci/mmol) were speed-vecuum dried. To each tube 
containing dried 33 P-UTP, the following ingredients were added: 

2.0 ml 5x transcription buffer 
1.0 ml DTT(100 mM) 
2.0 ml NTP mix (2.5 mM: 10 ml each of 10 mM GTP, CTP &amp; ATP + 10 ml H 2 O) 
1.0 ml UTP (50 mM) 
1.0 ml RNAsin 
1.0 ml DNA template (1 mg) 
1.0 ml H 2 O 
1.0 ml RNA polymerase (for PCR products T3 = AS, T7 = S, usually) 

[0318] The tubes were incubated at 37˚C for one hour. A total of 1.0 ml RQl DNase was added, followed by incubation 
at 37˚C for 15 minutes. A total of 90 ml TE (10 mM Tris pH 7.6/1 mM EDTA pH 8.0) was added, and the mixture was 
pipetted onto DE81 paper. The remaining solution was loaded in a MICROCON-50 ™ ultrafiltration unit, and spun using 
program 10 (6 minutes). The filtration unit was inverted over a second tube and spun using program 2 (3 minutes). After 
the final recovery spin, a total of 100 ml TE was added, then 1 ml of the final product was pipetted on DE81 paper and 
counted in 6 ml of BIOFLUOR II ™ . 
[0319] The probe was run on a TBE/urea gel. A total of 1-3 ml of the probe or 5 ml of RNA Mrk III was added to 3 ml 
of loading buffer. After heating on a 95˚C heat block for three minutes, the gel was immediately placed on ice. The wells 
of gel were flushed, and the sample was loaded and run at 180-250 volts for 45 minutes. The gel was wrapped in plastic 
wrap (SARAN ™ brand) and exposed to XAR film with an intensifying screen in a -70˚C freezer one hour to overnight.

33 P-Hybridization 

A. Pretreatment of frozen sections 

[0320] The slides were removed from the freezer, placed on aluminum trays, and thawed at room temperature for 5 
minutes. The trays were placed in a 55˚C incubator for five minutes to reduce condensation. The slides were fixed for 
10 minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde on ice in the fume hood, and washed in 0.5 x SSC for 5 minutes, at room temperature 
(25 ml 20 x SSC + 975 ml SQ H 2 O). After deproteination in 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K for 10 minutes at 37 ˚C (12.5 ml of 
10 mg/ml stock in 250 ml prewarmed RNAse-free RNAse buffer), the sections were washed in 0.5 x SSC for 10 minutes 
at room temperature. The sections were dehydrated in 70%, 95%, and 100% ethanol. 2 minutes each. 

B. Pretreatment of paraffin-embedded sections 

[0321] The slides were deparaffinized, placed in SQ H 2 O, and rinsed twice in 2 x SSC at room temperature, for 5 
minutes each time. The sections were deproteinated in 20 mg/ml proteinase K (500 ml of 10 mg/ml in 250 ml RNase-
free RNase buffer. 37˚C, 15 minutes) for human embryo tissue, or 8 x proteinase K (100ml in 250 ml Rnase buffer, 37˚C, 
30 minutes) for formalin tissues. Subsequent rinsing in 0.5 x SSC and dehydration were performed as described above. 

C. Prehybridization 

[0322] The slides were laid out in a plastic box lined with Box buffer (4 x SSC, 50% formamide) -saturated filter paper. 
The tissue was covered with 50 ml of hybridization buffer (3.75 g dextran sulfate + 6 ml SQ H 2 O), vortexed, and heated 
in the microwave for 2 minutes with the cap loosened. After cooling on ice, 18.75 ml formamide, 3.75 ml 20 x SSC, and 
9 ml SQ H 2 O were added, and the tissue was vortexed well and incubated at 42˚C for 1-4 hours. 

D. Hybridization 

[0323] 1.0 x 10 6 cpm probe and 1.0 ml tRNA (50 mg/ml stock) per slide were heated at 95˚C for 3 minutes. The slides 
were cooled on ice, and 48 ml hybridization buffer was added per slide. After vortexing, 50 ml 33 P mix was added to 50 
ml prehybridization on the slide. The slides were incubated overnight at 55 ˚C. 

E. Washes 

[0324] Washing was done for 2x10 minutes with 2xSSC, EDTA at room temperature (400 ml 20 x SSC + 16 ml 0.25 
M EDTA, V f =4L), followed by RNAseA treatment at 37˚C for 30 minutes (500 ml of 10 mg/ml in 250 ml Rnase buffer = 
20 mg/ml). The slides were washed 2 x 10 minutes with 2 x SSC, EDTA at room temperature. The stringency wash 
conditions were as follows: 2 hours at 55˚C, 0.1 x SSC, EDTA (20 ml 20 x SSC + 16 ml EDTA, V f =4L). 

EXAMPLE 6 

Use of PRO7133 

as a hybridization probe 

[0325] The following method describes use of a nucleotide sequence encoding a PRO7133 polypeptide as a hybrid-
ization probe. 
[0326] DNA comprising the coding sequence of a full-length or mature, polypeptide as disclosed herein and/or frag-
ments thereof may be employed as a probe to screen for homologous DNAs (such as those encoding naturally-occurring 
variants of in human tissue cDNA libraries or human tissue genomic libraries. 
[0327] Hybridization and washing of filters containing either library DNAs is performed under the following high strin-
gency conditions. Hybridization of radiolabeled probe to the filters is performed in a solution of 50% formamide. 5x SSC, 
0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 2x Denhardt's solution, and 10% dextran 
sulfate at 42˚C for 20 hours. Washing of the filters is performed in an aqueous solution of 0.1x SSC and 0.1% SDS at 42˚C. 
[0328] DNAs having a desired sequence identity with the DNA encoding full-length native sequence can then be 
identified using standard techniques known in the art.

EXAMPLE 7 

Expression of PRO7133 Polypeptides in E. coli. 

[0329] This example illustrates preparation of an unglycosylated form of PRO7133 by recombinant expression in E. coli. 
[0330] The DNA sequence encoding the PRO polypeptide of interest is initially amplified using selected PCR primers. 
The primers should contain restriction enzyme sites which correspond to the restriction enzyme sites on the selected 
expression vector. A variety of expression vectors may be employed. An example of a suitable vector is pBR322 (derived 
from E. coli; see Bolivar et al., Gene, 2:95 (1977)) which contains genes for ampicillin and tetracycline resistance. The 
vector is digested with restriction enzyme and dephosphorylated. The PCR amplified sequences are then ligated into 
the vector. The vector will preferably include sequences which encode for an antibiotic resistance gene, a trp promoter, 
a poly-His leader (including the first six STII codons, poly-His sequence, and enterokinase cleavage site), the PRO7133 
coding region, lambda transcriptional terminator, and an argU gene. 
[0331] The ligation mixture is then used to transform a selected E. coli strain using the methods described in Sambrook 
et al., supra. Transformants are identified by their ability to grow on LB plates and antibiotic resistant colonies are then 
selected. Plasmid DNA.can be isolated and confirmed by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. 
[0332] Selected clones can be grown overnight in liquid culture medium such as LB broth supplemented with antibiotics. 
The overnight culture may subsequently be used to inoculate a larger scale culture. The cells are then grown to a desired 
optical density, during which the expression promoter is turned on. 
[0333] After culturing the cells for several more hours, the cells can be harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet 
obtained by the centrifugation can be solubilized using various agents known in the art, and the solubilized PRO7133 
protein can then be purified using a metal chelating column under conditions that allow tight binding of the protein. 
[0334] PRO protein may be successfully expressed in E. coli in a poly-His tagged form using the following procedure. 
The DNA encoding is initially amplified using selected PCR primers. The primers contain restriction enzyme sites which 
correspond to the restriction enzyme sites on the selected expression vector, and other useful sequences providing for 
efficient and reliable translation initiation, rapid purification on a metal chelation column, and proteolytic removal with 
enterokinase. The PCR-amplified, poly-His tagged sequences are then ligated into an expression vector, which is used 
to transform an E. coli host based on strain 52 (W3110 fuhA(tonA) Ion galE rpoHts(htpRts) clpP(lacIq). Transformants 
are first grown in LB containing 50 mg/ml carbenicillin at 30˚C with shaking until an O.D. of 3-5 at 600 nm was reached. 
Cultures are then diluted 50-100 fold into CRAP media (prepared by mixing 3.57 g (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 0.71 g sodiumcitrate•2H 2 O, 
1.07 g KCl, 5.36 g Difco yeast extract. 5.36g Sheffield hycase SF in 500 ml water, as well as 110 mM MPOS, pH 7.3. 
0.55% (w/v) glucose and 7 mM MgSO 4 ) and grown for approximately 20-30 hours at 30˚C with shaking. Samples are 
removed to verify expression by SDS-PAGE analysis, and the bulk culture is centrifuged to pellet the cells. Cell pellets 
are frozen until purification and refolding. 
[0335] E. coli paste from 0.5 to 1 L fermentations (6-10 g pellets) is resuspended in 10 volumes (w/v) in 7 M guanidine, 
20 mM Tris, pH 8 buffer. Solid sodium sulfite and sodium tetrathionate are added to make final concentrations of 0.1M 
and 0.02 M, respectively, and the solution is stirred overnight at 4˚C. This step results in a denatured protein with all 
cysteine residues blocked by sulfitolization. The solution is centrifuged at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman Ultracentifuge for 
30 min. The supernatant is diluted with 3-5 volumes of metal chelate column buffer (6 M guanidine, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4) 
and filtered through 0.22 micron filters to clarify. The clarified extract is loaded onto a 5 ml Qiagen Ni 2+ -NTA metal 
chelate column equilibrated in the metal chelate column buffer. The column is washed with additional buffer containing 
50 mM imidazole (Calbiochem, Utrol grade), pH 7.4. The proteins are eluted with buffer containing 250 mM imidazole. 
Fractions containing the desired protein are pooled and stored at 4 ˚C. Protein concentration is estimated by its absorb-
ance at 280 nm using the calculated extinction coefficient based on its amino acid sequence. 
[0336] The protein is refolded by diluting sample slowly into freshly prepared refolding buffer consisting of: 20 mM 
Tris, pH 8.6, 0.3 M NaCl. 2.5 M urea, 5 mM cysteine. 20 mM glycine and 1 mM EDTA. Refolding volumes are chosen 
so that the final protein concentration is between 50 to 100 micrograms/ml. The refolding solution is stirred gently at 4˚C 
for 12-36 hours. The refolding reaction is quenched by the addition of TFA to a final concentration of 0.4% (pH of 
approximately 3). Before further purification of the protein, the solution is filtered through a 0.22 micron filter and acetonitrile 
is added to 2-10% final concentration. The refolded protein is chromatographed on a Poros R1/H reversed phase column 
using a mobile buffer of 0.1% TFA with elution with a gradient of acetonitrile from 10 to 80%. Aliquots of fractions with 
A 280 absorbance are analyzed on SDS polyacrylamide gels and fractions containing homogeneous refolded protein are 
pooled. Generally, the properly refolded species of most proteins are eluted at the lowest concentrations of acetonitrile 
since those species are the most compact with their hydrophobic interiors shielded from interaction with the reversed 
phase resin. Aggregated species are usually eluted at higher acetonitrile concentrations. In addition to resolving misfolded 
forms of proteins from the desired form, the reversed phase step also removes endotoxin from the samples. 
[0337] Fractions containing the desired folded PRO protein are pooled and the acetonitrile removed using a gentle 
stream of nitrogen directed at the solution. Proteins are formulated into 20 mM Hepes, pH 6.8 with 0.14 M sodium

EXAMPLE 8 

Expression of PRO7133 

in mammalian cells 

[0338] This example illustrates preparation of a potentially glycosylated form of PRO7133 by recombinant expression 
in mammalian cells. 
[0339] The vector, pRKS (see EP 307,247, published March 15, 1989), is employed as the expression vector. Op-
tionally, the PRO7133 DNA is ligated into pRK5 with selected restriction enzymes to allow insertion of the PRO7133 
DNA using ligation methods such as described in Sambrook et al., supra. The resulting vector is called. pRKS-PRO7133. 
[0340] In one embodiment, the selected host cells may be 293 cells. Human 293 cells (ATCC CCL 1573) are grown 
to confluence in tissue culture plates in medium such as DMEM supplemented with fetal calf serum and optionally, 
nutrient components and/or antibiotics. About 10 mg pRKS-PRO7133 DNA is mixed with about 1 mg DNA encoding the 
VA RNA gene [Thimmappaya et al., Cell, 31:543 (1982)] and dissolved in 500 ml of 1 mM Tris-HCl. 0.1 mM EDTA. 0.227 
M CaCl 2 . To this mixture is added, dropwise, 500 ml of 50 mM HEPES (PH 7.35), 280 mM NaCl. 1.5 mM NaPO 4 , and 
a precipitate is allowed to form for 10 minutes at 25˚C. The precipitate is suspended and added to the 293 cells and 
allowed to settle for about four hours at 37˚C. The culture medium is aspirated off and 2 ml of 20% glycerol in PBS is 
added for 30 seconds. The 293 cells are then washed with serum free medium, fresh medium is added and the cells 
are incubated for about 5 days. 
[0341] Approximately 24 hours after the transfections, the culture medium is removed and replaced with culture 
medium(alone) or culture medium containing 200 mCi/ml 15 S-cysteine and 200 mCi/ml 15 S-methionine. After a 12 hour 
incubation, the conditioned medium is collected, concentrated on a spin filter, and loaded onto a 15% SDS gel. The 
processed gel may be dried and exposed to film for a selected period of time to reveal the presence of the PRO7133 
polypeptide. The cultures containing transfected cells may undergo further incubation (in serum free medium) and the 
medium is tested in selected bioassays. 
[0342] In an alternative technique PRO7133 DNA may be introduced into 293 ceUs transiently using the dextran 
sulfate method described by Somparyrac et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.. 12:7573 (1981). 293 cells are grown to maximal 
density in a spinner flask and 700 mg pRKS-PRO7133 DNA is added. The cells are first concentrated from the spinner 
flask by centrifugation and washed with PBS. The DNA-dextran precipitate is incubated on the cell pellet for four hours. 
The cells are treated with 20% glycerol for 90 seconds, washed with tissue culture medium, and re-introduced into the 
spinner flask containing tissue culture medium. 5 mg/ml bovine insulin and 0.1 mg/ml bovine transferrin. After about four 
days, the conditioned media is centrifuged and filtered to remove cells and debris. The sample containing expressed 
PRO7133 can then be concentrated and purified by any selected method, such as dialysis and/or column chromatog-
raphy. 
[0343] In another embodiment PRO7133 can be expressed in CHO cells. The pRKS-PRO7133 vector can be trans-
fected into CHO cells using known reagents such as CaPO 4 or DEAE-dextran. As described above, the cell cultures 
can be incubated, and the medium replaced with culture medium (alone) or medium containing a radiolabel such as 15 S-
methionine. After determining the presence of the PRO7133 polypeptide, the culture medium may be replaced with 
serum free medium. Preferably, the cultures are incubated for about 6 days, and then the conditioned medium is har-
vested. The medium containing the expressed PRO7133 can then be concentrated and purified by any selected method. 
[0344] Epitope-tagged PRO7133 may also be expressed in host CHO cells. The PRO7133 may be subcloned out of 
the pRKS vector. The subclone insert can undergo PCR to fuse in frame with a selected epitope tag such as a poly-His 
tag into a Baculovirus expression vector. The poly-His tagged PRO7133 insert can then be subcloned into a SV40 driven 
vector containing a selection marker such as DHFR for selection of stable clones. Finally, the CHO cells can be transfected 
(as described above) with the SV40 driven vector. Labeling may be performed, as described above, to verify expression. 
The culture medium containing the expressed poly-His tagged PRO7133 can then be concentrated and purified by any 
selected method, such as by Ni 2+ -chelate affinity chromatography. Expression in CHO and/or COS cells may also be 
accomplished by a transient expression procedure. 
[0345] PRO protein may be expressed in CHO cells by a expression procedure or by a transient procedure. Stable 
expression in CHO cells is performed using the following procedure. The proteins are expressed as an IgG construct 
(immunoadhesin), in which the coding sequences for the soluble forms (e.g., extracellular domains) of the respective 
proteins were fused to an IgG constant region sequence containing the hinge, CH2 and CH2 domains and/or in a poly-
His tagged form 
[0346] Following PCR amplification, the respective DNAs are subcloned in a CHO expression vector using standard

techniques as described in Ausubel et al., Current Protocols of Molecular Biology, Unit 3.16, John Wiley and Sons 
(1997). CHO expression vectors are constructed to have compatible restriction sites 5' and 3' of the DNA of interest to 
allow the convenient shuttling of cDNA's. The vector used for expression in CHO cells is as described in Lucas et al., 
Nucl. Acids Res., 24:9 (1774,1779 (1996), and uses the SV40 early promoter/enhancer to drive expression of the cDNA 
of interest and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). DHFR expression permits selection for stable maintenance of the 
plasmid following transfection. 
[0347] Twelve micrograms of the desired plasmid DNA is introduced into approximately 10 million CHO cells using 
commercially available transfection reagents Superfect ® (Qiagen), Dosper ® or Fugene ® (Boehringer Mannheim). The 
cells are grown as described in Lucas et al., supra. Approximately 3 x 10 7 cells are frozen in an ampule for further growth 
and production as described below. 
[0348] The ampules containing the plasmid DNA are thawed by placement into a water bath and mixed by vortexing. 
The contents are pipetted into a centrifuge tube containing 10 mls of media and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes. 
The supernatant is aspirated and the cells are resuspended in 10 ml of selective media (0.2 mm filtered PS20 with 5% 
0.2 mm diafiltered fetal bovine serum). The cells are then aliquoted into a 100 ml spinner containing 90 ml of selective 
media. After 1-2 days, the cells are transferred into a 250 ml spinner filled with 150 ml selective growth medium and 
incubated at 37˚C. After another 2-3 days, 250 ml. 500 ml and 2000 ml spinners are seeded with 3 x 10 5 cells/ml. The 
cell media is exchanged with fresh media by centrifugation and resuspension in production medium. Although any 
suitable CHO media may be employed, a production medium described in US Patent No. 5,122,469, issued June 16, 
1992 is preferred. 3L production spinner is seeded at 1.2 x 10 6 cells/ml. On day 0. the cell number and pH are determined. 
On day 1, the spinner is sampled and sparging with filtered air is commenced. On day 2. the spinner is sampled, the 
temperature shifted to 33˚C, and 30 ml of 500 g/L glucose and 0.6 ml of 10% antifoam (e.g., 35% polydimethylsiloxane 
emulsion, Dow Corning 365 Medical Grade Emulsion) added. Throughout the production, the pH is adjusted as necessary 
to keep at around 7.2. After 10 days, or until viability dropped below 70%, the cell culture is harvested by centrifugation 
and filtered through a 0.22 mm fitter. The filtrate is either stored at 4˚C or immediately loaded onto columns for purification. 
[0349] For the poly-His tagged constructs, the proteins are purified using a Ni 2+ -NTA column (Qiagen). Before puri-
fication, imidazole is added to the conditioned media to a concentration of 5 mM. The conditioned media is pumped 
onto a 6 ml Ni 2+ -NTA column equilibrated in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, buffer containing 0.3 M NaCl and 5 mM imidazole 
at a flow rate of 4-5 ml/min. at 4˚C. After loading, the column is washed with additional equilibration buffer and the protein 
eluted with equilibration buffer containing 0.25 M imidazole. The highly purified protein is subsequently desalted into a 
storage buffer containing 10 mM Hepes, 0.14 M NaCl and 4% mannitol, pH 6.8, with a 25 ml G25 Superfine (Pharmacia) 
column and stored at -80˚C. 
[0350] Immunoadhesin (Fc containing) constructs are purified from the conditioned media as follows. The conditioned 
medium is pumped onto a 5 ml Protein A column (Pharmacia) which had been equilibrated in 20 mM Na phosphate 
buffer, pH 6.8. After loading, the column is washed extensively with equilibration buffer before elution with 100 mM citric 
acid, pH 3.5. The eluted protein is immediately neutralized by collecting 1 ml fractions into tubes containing 275 ml of 1 
M Tris buffer, pH 9. The highly purified protein is subsequently desalted into storage buffer as described above for the 
poly-His tagged proteins. The homogeneity is assessed by SDS polyacrylamide gels and by N-terminal amino acid 
sequencing by Edman degradation. 

EXAMPLE 9 

Expression of PRO7133 in Yeast 

[0351] The following method describes recombinant expression of PRO7133 in yeast. 
[0352] First, yeast expression vectors are constructed for intracellular production or secretion of PRO7133 from the 
ADH2/GAPDH promoter. DNA encoding PRO7133 and the promoter is inserted into suitable restriction enzyme sites 
in the selected plasmid to direct intracellular expression of PRO7133 For secretion, DNA encoding, PRO7133 can be 
cloned into the selected plasmid, together with DNA encoding the ADH2/GAPDH promoter, a native PRO7133 signal 
peptide or other mammalian signal peptide, or, for example, a yeast alpha-factor or invertase secretory signal/leader 
sequence, and linker sequences (if needed) for expression of PRO7133 
[0353] Yeast cells, such as yeast strain AB110, can then be transformed with the expression plasmids described 
above and cultured in selected fermentation media. The transformed yeast supernatants can be analyzed by precipitation 
with 10% trichloroacetic acid and separation by SDS-PAGE, followed by staining of the gels with Coomassie Blue stain. 
[0354] Recombinant PRO7133 can subsequently be isolated and purified by removing the yeast cells from the fer-
mentation medium by centrifugation and then concentrating the medium using selected cartridge filters. The concentrate 
containing PRO7133 may further be purified using selected column chromatography resins.

EXAMPLE 10 

Expression of in Baculovirus-infected Insect Cells 

[0355] The following method describes recombinant expression in Baculovirus-infected insect cells. 
[0356] The sequence coding for PRO7133 is fused upstream of an epitope tag contained within a baculovirus expres-
sion vector. Such epitope tags include poty-His tags and immunoglobulin tags (like Fc regions of IgG). A variety of 
plasmids may be employed, including plasmids derived from commercially available plasmids such as pVL1393 (No-
vagen). Briefly, the sequence encoding PRO7133 or the desired portion of the coding sequence of PRO7133 [such as 
the sequence encoding the extracellular domain of a transmembrane protein or the sequence encoding the mature 
protein if the protein is extracellular] is amplified by PCR with primers complementary to the 5' and 3' regions, The 5' 
primer may incorporate flanking (selected) restriction enzyme sites. The product is then digested with those selected 
restriction enzymes and subcloned into the expression vector. 
[0357] Recombinant baculovirus is generated byco-transfecting the above plasmid and BaculoGold ™ virus DNA (Phar-
rningen)into Spodoptera frugiperda("Sf9")cells(ATCCCRL 1711)using lipofectin(commercially available from GIBCO-
BRL). After 4 -5 days of incubation at 28˚C, the released viruses are harvested and used for further amplifications. Viral 
infection and protein expression are performed as described by O'Reilley et al., Baculovirus expression vectors: A 
Laboratory Manual, Oxford: Oxford University Press (1994). 
[0358] Expressed poly-His tagged PRO7133 can then be purified, for example, by Ni 2+ -chelate affinity chromatography 
as follows. Extracts are prepared from recombinant virus-infected Sf9 cells as described by Rupert et al., Nature, 362: 
175-179 (1993). Briefly, Sf9 cells are washed, resuspended in sonication buffer (25 ml Hepes, pH 7.9; 12.5 mM MgCl 2 ; 
0.1 mM EDTA; 10% glycerol; 0.1% NP-40; 0.4 M KCl), and sonicated twice for 20 seconds on ice. The sonicates are 
cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant is diluted 50-fold in loading buffer (50 mM phosphate, 300 mM NaCl. 
10% glycerol, pH 7.8) and filtered through a 0.45 mm filter. A Ni 2+ -NTA agarose column (commercially available from 
Qiagen) is prepared with a bed volume of 5 ml, washed with 25 ml of water and equilibrated with 25 ml of loading buffer. 
The filtered cell extract is loaded onto the column at 0.5 ml per minute. The column is washed to baseline A 280 with 
loading buffer, at which point fraction collection is started. Next, the column is washed with a secondary wash buffer (50 
mM phosphate; 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 6.0), which elutes nonspecifically bound protein. After reaching A 250 
baseline again, the column is developed with a 0 to 500 mM imidazole gradient in the secondary wash buffer. One ml 
fractions are collected and analyzed bySDS-PAGE and silver staining or Western blot with Ni 2+ -NTA-conjugated to 
alkaline phosphatase (Qiagen). Fractions containing the eluted His 10 -tagged PRO7133 respectively, are pooled and 
dialyzed against loading buffer. 
[0359] Alternatively, purification of the IgG tagged (or Fc tagged) PRO7133 can be performed using known chroma-
tography techniques, including for instance. Protein A or protein G column chromatography. 
[0360] While expression is actually performed in a 0.5-2 L scale, it can be readily scaled up for larger (e.g., 8 L) 
preparations. The proteins are expressed as an IgG construct (immunoadhesin), in which the protein extracellular region 
is fused to an IgG1 constant region sequence containing the hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains and/or in poly-His tagged 
forms. 
[0361] Following PCR amplification, the respective coding sequences are subcloned into a baculovirus expression 
vector (pb.PH.IgG for IgG fusions and pb.PH.His.c for poly-His tagged proteins), and the vector and Baculogold® 
baculovirus DNA (Pharmingen) are co-transfected into 105 Spodoptera frugiperda ("Sf9") cells (ATCC CRL 1711), using 
Lipofectin (Gibco BRL). pb.PH.IgG and pb.PH.His are modifications of the commercially available baculovirus expression 
vector pVL1393 (Pharmingen), with modified polylinker regions to include the His or Fc tag sequences. The cells are 
grown in Hink's TNM-FH medium supplemented with 10% FBS(Hyclone). Cells are incubated for 5 days at 28˚C. The 
supernatant is harvested and subsequently used for the first viral amplification by infecting Sf9 cells in Hink's TNM-FH 
medium supplemented with 10% FBS at an approximate multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. Cells are incubated for 3 
days at 28˚C. The supernatant is harvested and the expression of the constructs in the baculovirus expression vector 
is determined by batch binding of 1 ml of supernatant to 25 ml of Ni 2+ -NTA beads (QIAGEN) for histidine tagged proteins 
or Protein-A Sepharose CL-4B beads (Pharmacia) for IgG tagged proteins followed by SDS-PAGE analysis comparing 
to a known concentration of protein standard by Coomassie blue staining. 
[0362] The first viral amplification supernatant is used to infect a spinner culture (500 ml) of Sf9 cells grown in ESF-
921 medium (Expression Systems LLC) at an approximate MOI of 0.1. Cells are incubated for 3 days at 28 ˚C. The 
supernatant is harvested and filtered. Batch binding and SDS-PAGE analysis are repeated, as necessary, until expression 
of the spinner culture is confirmed. 
[0363] The conditioned medium from the transfected cells (0.5 to 3 L) is harvested by centrifugation to remove the 
cells and filtered through 0.22 micron filters. For the poly-His tagged constructs, the protein construct is purified using 
a Ni 2+ -NTA column (Qiagen). Before purification, imidazole is added to the conditioned media to a concentration of 5 
mM. The conditioned media is pumped onto a 6 ml Ni 2+ -NTA column equilibrated in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4. buffer

containing 0.3 M NaCl and 5 mM imidazole at a flow rate of 4-5 ml/min. at 4˚C. After loading, the column is washed with 
additional equilibration buffer and the protein eluted with equilibration buffer containing 0.25 M imidazole. The highly 
purified protein is subsequently desalted into a storage buffer containing 10 mM Hepes, 0.14 M NaCl and 4% mannitol, 
pH 6.8. with a 25 ml G25 Superfine (Pharmacia) column and stored at -80˚C. 
[0364] Immunoadhesin(Fc containing) constructs of proteins are purified from the conditioned media as follows. The 
conditioned media is pumped onto a 5 ml Protein A column (Pharmacia) which has been equilibrated in 20 mM Na 
phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. After loading, the column is washed extensively with equilibration buffer before elution with 
100 mM citric acid, pH 3.5. The eluted protein is immediately neutralized by collecting 1 ml fractions into tubes containing 
275 ml of 1 M Tris buffer, pH 9. The highly purified protein is subsequently desalted into storage buffer as described 
above for the poly-His tagged proteins. The homogeneity of the proteins is verified by SDS polyacrylamide gel (PEG) 
electrophoresis and N-terminal amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation. 
[0365] PRO protein may be expressed in Baculovirus infected Sf9 insect cells by the above procedure. 
[0366] Alternatively, a modified baculovirus procedure may be used incorporating high 5 cells. In this procedure, the 
DNA encoding the desired sequence is amplified with suitable systems, such as Pfu (Stratagene), or fused upstream 
(5'-of) of an epitope tag contained with a baculovirus expression vector. Such epitope tags include poly-His tags and 
immunoglobulin tags (like Fc regions of IgG). A variety of plasmids may be employed, including plasmids derived from 
commercially available plasmids such as pIE1-1 (Novagen). The pIE1-1 and pIE1-2 vectors are designed for constitutive 
expression of recombinant proteins from the baculovirus iel promoter in stably-transformed insect cells. The plasmids 
differ only in the orientation of the multiple cloning sites and contain all promoter sequences known to be important for 
iel-mediated gene expression in uninfected insect cells as well as the hr5 enhancer element pIE1-1 and pIE1-2 include 
the translation initiation site and can be used to produce fusion proteins. Briefly, the desired sequence or the desired 
portion of the sequence (such as the sequence encoding the extracellular domain of a transmembrane protein) is 
amplified by PCR with primers complementary to the 5' and 3' regions. The 5' primer may incorporate flanking (selected) 
restriction enzyme sites. The product is then digested with those selected restriction enzymes and subcloned into the 
expression vector. For example, derivatives of pIE1-1 can include the Fc region of human IgG (pb.PH.IgG)or an 8 
histidine (pb.PH.His) tag downstream (3'-of) the desired sequence. Preferably, the vector construct is sequenced for 
confirmation. 
[0367] High 5 cells are grown to a confluency of 50% under the conditions of 27˚C, no CO 2 , NO pen/strop. For each 
150 mm plate, 30mg of pIE based vector containing the sequence is mixed with 1 ml Ex-Cell medium (Media: Ex-Cell 
401 + 1/100 L-Glu JRH Biosciences #14401-78P (note: this media is light sensitive)), and in a separate tube, 100 ml of 
CellFectin (CellFECTIN (GibcoBRL#10362-010)(vortexed to mix)) is mixed with 1 ml of Ex-Cell medium. The two solutions 
are combined and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes. 8 ml of Ex-Cell media is added to the 2 ml 
of DNA/CellFECTIN mix and this is layered on high 5 cells that have been washed once with Ex-Cell media. The plate 
is then incubated in darkness for 1 hour at room temperature. The DNA/CellFECTIN mix is then aspirated, and the cells 
are washed once with Ex-Cell to remove excess CellFECTIN, 30 ml of fresh Ex-Cell media is added and the cells are 
incubated for 3 days at 28˚C. The supernatant is harvested and the expression of the sequence in the baculovirus 
expression vector is determined by batch binding of 1 ml of supernatant to 25 ml of Ni 2+ -NTA beads (QIAGEN) for 
histidine tagged proteins or Protein-A Sepharose CL-4B beads (Pharmacia) for IgG tagged proteins followed by SDS-
PAGE analysis comparing to a known concentration of protein standard by Coomassie blue staining. 
[0368] The conditioned media from the transfected cells (0.5 to 3 L) is harvested by centrifugation to remove the cells 
and filtered through 0.22 micron filters. For the poly-His tagged constructs, the protein comprising the sequence is 
purified using a Ni 2+ -NTA column (Qiagen). Before purification, imidazole is added to the conditioned media to a con-
centration of 5 mM. The conditioned media is pumped onto a 6 ml Ni 2+ -NTA column equilibrated in 20 mM Hopes, pH 
7.4, buffer containing 0.3 M NaCl and 5 mM imidazole at a flow rate of 4-5 ml/min. at 48˚C. After loading, the column is 
washed with additional equilibration buffer and the protein eluted with equilibration buffer containing 0.25 M imidazole. 
The highly purified protein is then subsequently desalted into a storage buffer containing 10 mM Hopes. 0.14 M NaCl 
and 4% mannitol, pH 6.8. with a 25 ml G25 Superfine (Pharmacia) column and stored at -80˚C. 
[0369] Immunoadhesin (Fc containing) constructs of proteins are purified from the conditioned media as follows. The 
conditioned media is pumped onto a 5 ml Protein A column (Pharmacia) which has been equilibrated in 20 mM Na 
phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. After loading, the column is washed extensively with equilibration buffer before elution with 
100 mM citric acid, pH 3.5. The eluted protein is immediately neutralized by collecting 1 ml fractions into tubes containing 
275 ml of 1 M Tris buffer, pH 9. The highly purified protein is subsequently desalted into storage buffer as described 
above for the poly-His tagged proteins. The homogeneity of the sequence is assessed by SDS polyacrylamide gels and 
by N-terminal amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation and other analytical procedures as desired or necessary.

EXAMPLE 11 

Preparation of Antibodies that Bind PRO7133 

[0370] This example illustrates preparation of monoclonal antibodies which can specifically bind PRO7133 
[0371] Techniques for producing the monoclonal antibodies are known in the art and are described, for instance, in 
Goding, supra. Immunogens that may be employed include purified PRO7133 fusion proteins containing PRO7133 and 
cells expressing recombinant PRO7133 on the cell surface. Selection of the immunogen can be made by the skilled 
artisan without undue experimentation. 
[0372] Mice, such as Balb/c, are immunized with the PRO7133 immunogen emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant 
and injected subcutaneously or intraperitoneally in an amount from 1-100 micrograms. Alternatively, the immunogen is 
emulsified in MPL-TDM adjuvant (Ribi Immunochemical Research. Hamilton. MT) and injected into the animal's hind 
foot pads. The immunized mice are then boosted 10 to 12 days later with additional immunogen emulsified in the selected 
adjuvant. Thereafter, for several weeks, the mice may also be boosted with additional immunization injections. Serum 
samples may be periodically obtained from the mice by retro-orbital bleeding for testing in ELISA assays to detect anti-
PRO7133 antibodies. 
[0373] After a suitable antibody titer has been detected, the animals "positive" for antibodies can be injected with a 
final intravenous injection of PRO7133. Three to four days later, the mice are sacrificed and the spleen cells are harvested. 
The spleen cells are then fused (using 35% polyethylene glycol) to a selected murine myeloma cell line such as 
P3X63AgU.1. available from ATCC, No. CRL 1597. The fusions generate hybridoma cells which can then be plated in 
96 well tissue culture plates containing HAT (hypoxanthine, aminopterin. and thymidine) medium to inhibit proliferation 
of non-fused cells, myeloma hybrids, and spleen cell hybrids. 
[0374] The hybridoma cells will be screened in an ELISA for reactivity against PRO7133 Determination of "positive" 
hybridoma cells secreting the desired monoclonal antibodies against PRO7133 is within the skill in the art. 
[0375] The positive hybridoma cells can be injected intraperitoneally into syngeneic Balb/c mice to produce ascites 
containing the anti-PRO7133 monoclonal antibodies. Alternatively, the hybridoma cells can be grown in tissue culture 
flasks or roller bottles. Purification of the monoclonal antibodies produced in the ascites can be accomplished using 
ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by gel exclusion chromatography. Alternatively, affinity chromatography based 
upon binding of antibody to protein A or protein G can be employed.

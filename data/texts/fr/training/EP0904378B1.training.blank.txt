Description 

[0001] On a global scale, the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the most significant of the hepatotrophic viruses in terms of 
the number of people chronically infected and the severity of the complications of infection. 
[0002] Hepatitis B emerged as a major problem after the introduction of parenteral therapy, mass immunisation cam-
paigns and the extensive transfusion of blood and pooled blood products. Long incubation periods, high incidence of 
asymptomatic infections and the occurrences of an infectious carrier state make HBV well suited to transmission by 
blood. Numerous workers have also provided evidence for sexual transmission of HBV, and transmission of hepatitis B 
virus from carrier mothers to their babies can occur during the perinatal period. 
[0003] HBV, a DNA virus, is a member of the hepadna virus group. Electron microscopy of the HBV reveals a double 
shelled, spherical particle of 42nm in diameter called the "Dane particle". Those virus particles exhibit an electron dense 
spherical inner core with a diameter of approximately 22-25nm and an outer coat 7nm in thickness. The outer coat of 
the virus bears the surface antigen (called herein "HBs" or "HBsAg") to which virus-neutralising antibody is directed. 
The spherical 20nm diameter inner-core particles bear the viral core antigen (HBcAg) and the e antigen (HBeAg), the 
viral DNA, DNA polymerase activity and a protein kinase activity. 
[0004] HBsAg contains the major neutralising epitope of HBV, termed the "a" determinant, which spans amino acids 
124 to 147 and is common to all HBV isolates, see for example, Pugh et al (1986). The development of anti-HBs after 
acute or chronic HBV infection is usually associated with recovery and a good prognosis. Anti-HBs is also associated 
with the production of neutralising antibodies resulting from vaccination. The majority of anti-HBs found in convalescent 
and post-vaccination sera binds in the region of the "a" determinant, which has an as yet undefined structure. It is clear 
that the "a" determinant is highly conformational because denaturation of that area by alkylation or reduction gives rise 
to HBsAg particles with greatly reduced antigenicity. It is thought that disulphide bridges between cysteine residues are 
responsible for correct conformation. One possible structure of the "a" determinant involves a disulphide bridge between 
amino acids 124 and 137, forming a first loop, and a further disulphide bridge between amino acids 139 and 147, forming 
a second loop. 
[0005] Anti-HBs is thought to bind predominantly to the second loop but it is thought that the epitopes are not confined 
to one loop only. The whole of the sequence of the "a" determinant probably contributes to the antigenic structure. The 
"a" determinant is conserved though there is a degree of amino acid variation in normal isolates of HBV. Greater variation 
is accepted in the first loop of the putative epitope, perhaps implying that this region does not contribute significantly to 
the neutralisation epitope. 
[0006] The "a" determinant is found in all subtypes of HBV and it is variation of amino acids within and around the "a" 
determinant that gives rise to subtypes. HBsAg can be classified into four major immunological subtypes, adw, ayw, 
adr, and ayr, each with an associated geographical distribution. The d/y and w/r subtypes are determined by substitutions 
of lysine by arginine at amino acids 122 and 160 respectively. 
[0007] Recently, the presence of HBsAg has been observed in anti-HBs serum samples of certain patients. The HBsAg 
in those patients may not be neutralised by the anti-HBs present, implying the presence of HBsAg variants. Significant 
variants (mutants) have been associated with vaccination, monoclonal antibody therapy, polyclonal antibody therapy 
and cases of HBV infection difficult to diagnose in clinical laboratories see, for example, Carmen et al. (1992, 1993), 
Harrison et al. (1993), Hawkins et al. (1994), Howard et al. (1993), McMahon et al. (1992), Okamoto et al. (1992), and 
Wallace et al. (1994). 
[0008] Upon analysis the mutants seem to have been selected from a mixed population and to have point mutations 
causing amino acid substitutions in the "a" determinant. The mutants are thought to arise by random mutations within 
the gene which gives rise to a pool of genotypes. In the mutants described to date, it is thought that the immune response 
is the predominant factor in selecting for the mutants. 
[0009] Generally, addition of monoclonal antibodies to virus infected cells in vitro result in selection of isolates that 
are not neutralised by that antibody. It is thus not surprising that monoclonal antibodies given to patients with active viral 
replication can result in selection of so-called "escape" mutants. 
[0010] Several separate escape mutants with clinical significance have been described in vaccinated individuals. In 
three cases there was found to be a point mutation at the codon for amino acid 145 in the "a" determinant of HBsAg 
resulting in an amino acid change from glycine to arginine. Administration of serum containing one such mutant virus to 
a chimpanzee proved that the agents are transmissible. 
[0011] In a mutant virus implicated in a breakthrough infection in a vaccinated population, a lysine to glutamic acid 
mutation at amino acid 141 of the "a" determinant was found. That and other point mutations resulting in one or more 
amino acid substitutions in the "a" determinant have since been reported in vaccinated individuals. 
[0012] Escape mutants are a cause for concern on several accounts. Firstly, there is failure to detect such mutants 
by immunoassays. Diagnostic assays are designed to achieve high sensitivity and specificity. Assays for HBsAg detection 
depend on interaction between an anti-HBs reagent and HBsAg in the sample under investigation. A resulting anti-HBs/ 
HBsAg complex is then detected. If there is a significant mutation in the HBsAg epitope and it is not recognised by the 


EP 0 904 378 B1 

3 

5 





















anti-HBs, then the HBsAg will either not be detected or the assay will be very insensitive. Failure to detect an escape 
mutant may not only affect the person harbouring the mutant; it may lead to transmission of infection through donated 
blood, blood products or organs. Secondly, HBV with mutant HBsAg may infect individuals even though they have been 
previously immunised and have an anti-HBs response. 
[0013] A monoclonal antibody to an escape mutant at position 122 has been described in WO94/26904. That antibody 
is able to discriminate between the wild type HBsAg and the mutant form and hence enables identification of the mutant 
form. 
[0014] WO 95/21189 discloses a hepatitis B surface antigen protein comprising an antigenically modified envelope 
region in which at least two amino acids are inserted downstream of position 122. 
[0015] WO 94/21812 discloses antibodies for use in the detection of specific hepatitis B surface antigen protein variants 
having a glycine to arginine substitution at position 145. 
[0016] Waters et al., (1992) J. Clin.Invest. 90: 2543-2597 discloses a hepatitis B surface antigen mutation at amino 
acid 145 which leads to evasion of protective anti-HBs response and speculates that the mutation arose as a result of 
immune pressure. 
[0017] The present invention relates to a monoclonal antibody that is capable of binding specifically to a wild-type 
HBsAg and to at least two, preferable more than two, mutant forms of HBsAg. 
The present invention provides monoclonal antibody P2D3 as produced by the hybridoma designated P2D3 and de-
posited at the ECACC under accession number 97042331 and monoclonal antibodies that cross-compete with mono-
clonal antibody P2D3 for binding to a wild type HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen) and to at least two mutant forms of 
HBsAg, wherein the mutant forms of HBsAg have an amino acid substitution relative to wild type HBs Ag within the 
sequence encoding amino acids 133 to 145 of HBsAg. Unless specified otherwise, the term "a monoclonal antibody of 
the present invention" includes monoclonal antibody P2D3 and monoclonal antibodies that cross-compete with mono-
clonal antibody P2D3 as defined above. 
[0018] The ability of a monoclonal antibody of the present invention to bind specifically to both a wild type and mutant 
HBsAg suggests that it is binding to a region of the surface antigen that is conserved between the wild type protein and 
the mutant forms. The conserved region and hence the antigenic determinant (or epitope) may be in the "a" determinant 
itself, in the region of the "a" determinant or even in a non-"a" region. 
[0019] Because of its ability to bind specifically to mutant forms of HBsAg as well as to a wile type protein, and hence 
to detect escape mutants, a monoclonal antibody of the present invention is particularly useful in improving the efficacy 
of immunoassays for the detection of HBsAg, for clinical diagnosis of HBV infections and also for blood screening. The 
safety of the bloody supply and off the supply of blood products may be improved by the use of a monoclonal antibody 
of the invention in an HBsAg assay, either alone that is to say, as the only anti-HBs antibody or, especially, in addition 
to one or more other anti-HBs antibodies. 
[0020] Figures 1a and 1b of the accompanying drawings set out amino acid and nucleic acid sequences of part of the 
HBV surface region encompassing the "a" determinant. Figure 1b of the drawings as filed is a typescript version of Figure 
la. In each of Figures 1a and 1b: Line 1 sets out recognised amino acid variants of subtype adyw; Line 2 sets out the 
consensus amino acid sequence of subtype adyw; Line 3 sets out the consensus nucleic acid sequence of subtype 
adyw; Line 4 sets out recognised nucleic acids variants; Line 5 sets out the nucleic acid variants encoding Mutant HBsAg 
II (MAM HBsAg); and Line 6 sets out the nucleic acid variants encoding Mutant HBsAg I (NP HBsAg). 
[0021] A further recognised nucleotide variant at position 143 is ACG for TCG, which results in threonine instead of 
serine at that position. 
[0022] A putative monoclonal antibody of the present invention may be screened for the ability to cross-compere with 
monoclonal antibody P2D3 for binding to three or more reference antigens namely a wild type HBsAg and two or more 
mutant forms of HBsAg. A skilled worker is able readily to distinguish specific binding between an antibody and an 
antigen from non-specific binding. Any antibody that is capable of such cross-competition for binding to three or more 
such reference antigens is a monoclonal antibody of the present invention. Such a method of screening is itself part of 
the present invention. It should be noted that the term "binding" is used throughout the present specification to denote 
specific binding. 
[0023] An HBsAg used for screening and/or as an antigen in the production of hybridomas and monoclonal antibodies 
of the invention may be a full length protein or may be an appropriate antigenic fragment or derivative of a wild type or 
mutant HBsAg. 
[0024] A monoclonal antibody of the present invention may be of any immunoglobulin class, for example, IgG, IgM or 
IgA, and of any isotype. 
[0025] Mutant forms of HBsAg may be found in mutant viruses having a mutation that leads to at least one amino acid 
substitution relative to wild type HBsAg, for example, as found in so-called "escape mutants". A mutant HBsAg may 
have a substitution in the "a" determinant or in the region of the "a" determinant, for example, the mutation may be a 
point mutation. A mutation, for example, a point mutation, may be within the sequence encoding amino acids 133 to 145 
of HBsAg. The mutation may lead to an amino acid substitution at position 133 and/or at position 145. Further and/or 


EP 0 904 378 B1

5 





















different substitutions may be present, for example, at any one or more of positions 134, 141, 142, 143 and 144. A 
mutant HBsAg may, for example, have amino acid substitutions relative to the wild type at any one or more of positions 
143, 144 and 145. Such mutations may be present in addition to other mutations, either in the "a" determinant or in 
another region. 
[0026] A monoclonal antibody of the present invention is capable of cross-competing with monoclonal antibody P2D3 
for binding for example, to a wild-type HBsAg and to two or more different mutant HBsAg as described above, for 
example, each having a mutation at any one or more of positions 133, 134, 141, 142, 143, 144 and 145. Alternatively, 
binding may be to one mutant HBsAg described above and to a mutant HBsAg having a mutation in a different region. 
[0027] Examples of mutant forms of HBsAg are those having the following substitutions relative to the wild type in the 
region of the "a" determinant: 

Mutant HBsAg I ("NP" HBsAg): met to ile at amino acid 133; phe to his at amino acid 134; and asp to val at amino 
acid 144; 
Mutant HBsAg II ("MAM" HBsAg): met to ile at amino acid 133; phe to asn at amino acid 134; pro to ser at amino 
acid 142; ser to leu at amino acid 143; and gly to lys at amino acid 145; 
Mutant HBsAg III ("SZ" HBsAg): gly to arg at amino acid 145; Mutant HBsAg IV ("SP" HBsAg): ser to met at amino 
acid 143. 

[0028] A putative antibody may be screened, for example, against a wild type HBsAg and against any two or more of 
the mutant forms described above. For example, a putative monoclonal antibody of the present invention may be screened 
against a wild-type HBsAg and against two or more different mutant HBsAg each having mutation (s) at any one or more 
of positions 133, 134, 141, 142, 143, 144 and 145, especially 143, 144 and 145. Alternatively, one such mutant may be 
used with a mutant HBsAg having a mutation in a different region. Mutant forms I and IV described above may be used 
for screening. 
[0029] A monoclonal antibody of the invention may be capable of binding specifically to a wild-type HBsAg and to at 
least one mutant HBsAg carrying an "a" determinant coded for by a sequence having point mutations at any one or more 
of the codons encoding amino acids 143, 144 and 145. The monoclonal antibody may bind to two or more such mutant 
HBsAg or to one such mutant HBsAg and to another different mutant HBsAg. 
[0030] Examples of monoclonal antibodies of the present invention are those produced by the hybridomas designated 
P2D3, M3A10 and M4F5, which hybridomas have been deposited at the European Collection of Cell Structures (ECACC), 
Virus Research and Production Laboratory, Public Health Laboratory Service, Centre for Applied Microbiology &amp; Re-
search, Porton Down, Salisbury, Wiltshire SP4 OJG, England, under the terms of the Budapest Treaty on the International 
Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure, 1977. The accession numbers and 
dates of the hybridoma deposits are as follows: Hybridoma P2D3: Accession Number ECACC 97042331, Accession 
Date 23 April 1997; Hybridoma M3A10: Accession Number ECACC 97042330, Accession Date 23 April 1997; Hybridoma 
M4F5: Accession Number ECACC 97042519, Accession Date 25 April 1997. 
[0031] In this specification, a monoclonal antibody may be referred to under the same designation as the hybridoma 
that produces it, for example, the monoclonal antibody designated P2D3 is as produced by hybridoma P2D3 (ECACC 
97042331). Hybridomas P2D3 (ECACC 97042331), M3A10 (ECACC 97042330) and M4F5 (ECACC 97042519) and 
the monoclonal antibodies they produce are described in detail in the Examples below. 
[0032] Each of the monoclonal antibodies P2D3, M3A10 and M4F5 is capable of binding specifically to (i) a wild type 
HBsAG, (ii) Mutant HBsAG I (NP HBsAG) and (iii) Mutant HBsAg II (MAM HBsAg). Furthermore, each also is capable 
of binding specifically to Mutant HBsAg III (SZ HBsAg) and to Mutant HBsAg IV (SP HBsAg). Monoclonal antibodies 
P2D3 and M4F5 are IgG antibodies. Monoclonal antibody M3A10 is an IgA antibody. 
[0033] It is known that wild type HBsAg has a number of different serotypes, and also that there are recognised mutants 
see, for example, Pugh et al 1980. The term "wild type HBsAg" as used in the present specification includes all HBsAg 
that are recognised in the art as wild type or that would be acknowledged to be wild type. The term therefore includes 
wild type HBsAg of all serotypes and of all recognised variants. The term "mutant HBsAg" as used herein does not 
include recognised wild type variants. 
[0034] Suitable screening tests are well known to those skilled in the art and include cross-competition assays and 
assays, for example, using radio-labelled monoclonal antibody to determine binding specificities. 
[0035] As stated above, the ability of a monoclonal antibody of the present invention to bind to both a wild type and 
mutant HBsAg suggests that it is binding to a region of the surface antigen that is conserved between the wild type 
protein and the mutant forms. (See also the General Discussion below.) The location and the sequence of such a 
conserved region and hence a conserved epitope may be determined by known methods, for example, by epitope 
mapping optionally using a monoclonal antibody of the invention. Epitopic peptides and polypeptides may then be 
produced, for example, recombinantly, by chemical synthesis or by a combination of different methods. A resulting 
antigenic peptide or polypeptide may also be immunogenic. An epitope against which a monoclonal antibody of the 


EP 0 904 378 B1 

5 

5 





















invention is directed is itself part of the present invention. 
[0036] The present invention includes fragments and derivatives of a monoclonal antibody of the present invention, 
for example, Fab and Fab 2 fragments and conjugates. Derivatives include humanised derivatives. Methods for producing 
fragments and derivatives, including humanised derivatives, are well known. For example, fragments and derivatives 
may be produced recombinantly. Fragments and derivatives of antibodies and their uses are well known to the skilled 
worker. The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein includes fragments and derivatives thereof. 
[0037] The present invention also provides an anti-idiotype antibody to a monoclonal antibody of the present invention. 
Such antibodies, which comprises an "internal image" of the original epitope, may be used as epitope substitutes and 
are particularly useful in the case of conformational epitopes, since it is difficult to map such epitopes and it may not be 
possible to produce synthetic epitopic peptides in such cases. 
[0038] A monoclonal antibody of the present invention may be used in an immunoassay for the detection of HBsAg 
("HBV assay") and hence of hepatitis B infections, either as a substitute for or, especially, in addition to anti-HBs antibodies 
currently used in HBV assays. Such assays may be used for clinical diagnosis or for blood screening, and the present 
invention includes both methods of diagnosis and methods of blood screening using an immunoassay comprising a 
monoclonal antibody of the present invention. 
[0039] A monoclonal antibody of the present invention may also be used therapeutically or prophylactically as an 
antiserum for passive immunisation and/or to define an epitope for use as a vaccine in active immunisation. The present 
invention includes such antisera and methods of immunisation, and also epitopes defined using such antisera. 
[0040] A further application of a monoclonal antibody of the present invention is in affinity chromatography, for example, 
to purify wild or mutant types of HBsAg, antigenic fragments thereof, antigenic peptides or anti-idiotype antibodies. 
[0041] Accordingly, the present invention provides an immunoassay for the detection of HBsAg, which comprises 
contacting a sample under investigation with a monoclonal antibody of the present invention, a fragment or derivative 
thereof, or a combination of two or more thereof, and detecting any resulting antigen-antibody complex. 
[0042] The term "detection" is used herein to denote detection and/or determination and includes qualitative, quanti-
tative and semi-quantitative methods. 
[0043] The monoclonal antibody of the invention, fragment, derivative or combination thereof may be used with one 
or more other antibodies selected from polyclonal anti-HBs antibodies and other monoclonal anti-HBs antibodies. 
[0044] An immunoassay of the present invention may be in a homogeneous or heterogeneous format. The format 
may be a capture or a competitive format. 
[0045] An immunoassay for the detection of antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) may be carried out 
simultaneously with the assay for HBsAg. HBV combination anti-core/ surface antigen assays are known and are in use. 
[0046] The present invention further provides an immunoassay kit that comprises a monoclonal antibody of the present 
invention or a fragment or derivative thereof, or a combination of two or more thereof, and other reagents required for 
carrying out an immunoassay for HBsAg and optionally also reagents for detecting anti-HBc antibodies. One or more 
other anti-HBs antibodies selected from polyclonal anti-HBs antibodies and other monoclonal anti-HBs antibodies may 
be present, and the other reagents may be selected from washing solutions, diluents, standard solutions, control reagents 
and labelled anti-HBs antibodies. 
[0047] The present invention further provides a solid phase suitable for use in an immunoassay on which is immobilised 
a monoclonal antibody of the present invention, a fragment or derivative thereof, or a combination of two or more thereof. 
One or more further anti-HBs antibodies selected from polyclonal anti-HBs antibodies and other monoclonal anti-HBs 
antibodies may also immobilised on the solid phase. Furthermore, an agent capable of capturing anti-HBc antibodies 
may be immobilised on the solid phase in addition to the anti-HBs antibodies. 
[0048] The present invention further provides an antiserum suitable for use therapeutically or prophylactically for 
passive immunisation which comprises a monoclonal antibody of the present invention, a fragment or derivative thereof, 
or a combination of two or more thereof. 
[0049] The present invention also provides a composition suitable for use therapeutically or prophylactically for passive 
immunisation against HBV which comprises a monoclonal antibody of the present invention, a fragment or derivative 
thereof, or a combination of two or more thereof, in admixture with a pharmaceutically suitable carrier. 
[0050] An antiserum or composition of the invention may also comprises one or more other antibodies selected from 
polyclonal anti-HBs antibodies and other monoclonal anti-HBs antibodies. 
[0051] The present invention further provides a method of therapeutic or prophylactic passive immunisation against 
HBV which comprises administering to a human a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a monoclonal 
antibody of the invention, a fragment or derivative thereof or a combination of two or more thereof. One or more other 
antibodies selected from monoclonal and polyclonal anti-HBs antibodies may also be administered. 
[0052] For any of the applications and uses according to the present invention, the monoclonal antibody of the present 
invention may be monoclonal antibody P2D3, monoclonal antibody M3A10, monoclonal antibody M4F5 or a combination 
of two of more thereof. Any one or more of the monoclonal antibodies P2D3, M3A10 and M4F5 may be used together 
with any other monoclonal antibody of the present invention and/or with any other anti-HBV antibodies, especially antiHBS 


EP 0 904 378 B1

antibodies. A fragment or derivative of a monoclonal antibody of the invention may be used. 
[0053] The present invention also provides a hybridoma capable of producing a monoclonal antibody of the present 
invention, for example, hybridoma P2D3 (Accession Number ECACC 97042331), hybridoma M3A10 (Accession Number 
ECACC 97042330) and hybridoma M4F5 (Accession Number ECACC 97042519). 
[0054] The present invention provides a method of producing a hybridoma capable of producing a monoclonal antibody 
of the present invention, which comprises immunising an animal with wild type HBsAg or a mutant form of HBsAg, 
immortalising antibody producing cells to form hybridomas, screening the resulting hybridoma culture against wild type 
HBsAg and two or more mutant forms of HBsAg, and selecting those hybridomas that produce a monoclonal antibody 
that is capable of binding specifically to wild type HBsAg and two or more mutant forms of HBsAg. 
[0055] A monoclonal antibody of the invention may be obtained by culturing a hybridoma of the invention in vitro or 
in vivo and obtaining the monoclonal antibody from the culture medium. In the case of in vivo production, the culture 
medium is ascitic fluid. 
[0056] Methods for raising and for screening hybridomas and monoclonal antibodies are well known to those skilled 
in the art. The general methodology is set out by Kohler &amp; Milstein (1975) and there have been numerous publications 
on the subject since then. Any such method may be used to raise and to screen hybridomas and monoclonal antibodies 
according to a method of the present invention. The antigen used to raise the antibodies may be a wild type HBsAg or 
a mutant form of HBsAg, for example, as described above, for example, one or more of the mutant forms I to IV described 
above. The screening of the resulting hybridomas and monoclonal antibodies for their ability to bind specifically to different 
forms of HBsAg may be carried out by any conventional method using wild type HBsAg and the chosen mutant forms. 
As described above, screening may carried out using, as reference antigens, a wild type HBsAg and two or more mutant 
forms of HBsAg, for example, as described above, for example, two or more of the mutant forms I to IV. 
[0057] For screening, it is particularly convenient to use an IgG reverse capture radioimmunoassay, which is capable 
of a very low background and a large dynamic range, and has the further advantage of being simple to set up. 
[0058] In an IgG reverse capture assay for an antibody of interest, an appropriate anti-species IgG is immobilised on 
a solid phase, for example, microwells. If, for example, the antibodies under investigation have been raised in mice, then 
the solid phase is coated with anti-mouse IgG. The sample under investigation is then incubated with the immobilised 
anti-species IgG, whereupon a representative proportion the total IgGs present in the sample are captured. The solid 
phase is then incubated with an appropriate labelled antigen, which forms a complex only with the captured antibody of 
interest. Any complexes formed may then be detected. 
[0059] In the present case, a sample under investigation, for example, a tissue culture supernatant fluid from a hybri-
doma culture or ascitic fluid, is incubated with immobilised anti-IgG. The captured antibodies are incubated separately 
with a labelled wild type HBsAg and with two or more labelled mutant HBsAgs, for example, as described above, for 
example, selected from mutant forms I to IV. Any sample that is capable of binding specifically a wild type HBsAg and 
two or more mutant surface antigens contains a monoclonal antibody that falls within the present invention. 
[0060] A reverse phase IgM or IgA assay may be used analogously to obtain an IgM or IgA monoclonal antibody. 
[0061] Commercially available immunoassays for HBsAg are generally heterogeneous phase or "capture" assays, in 
which anti-HBs is immobilised on a solid phase, usually microwells, small particles or beads. When a sample under 
investigation, generally serum, is contacted with the immobilised anti-HBs, HBsAg present in the sample should bind to 
the immobilised antibody. The captured antigen is then detected, generally using a labelled anti-HBs. In conventional 
assays, the antibody used for capture or for detection may be monoclonal or polyclonal. 
[0062] Polyclonal antibodies, because of their nature, have a range of specificity and selectivity. In the case of HBV, 
this may result in the presence in the antiserum of an antibody that can bind to an escape mutant. However, that cannot 
be guaranteed, and there is an inherent problem in obtaining uniformity of product from batch to batch. Monoclonal 
antibodies have defined specificity and selectivity and may therefore fail to detect escape mutants. 
[0063] The use of a monoclonal antibody of the present invention, which is capable of binding specifically to both a 
wild type HBsAg and to mutant HBsAg, or a combination of two or more such antibodies, including fragments and 
derivatives thereof, in an immunoassay for HBsAg improves the performance of the assay and reduces the possibility 
that mutant HBsAg will not be detected. A monoclonal antibody of the present invention or a combination of two or more 
such antibodies may be used either as the only anti-HBs antibody reagent or, preferably, may be used in addition to 
polyclonal anti-HBs or other monoclonal anti-HBs, for antigen capture and/or for detection of any resulting antibody-
antigen complex. A monoclonal antibody of the present invention, or a combination of two or more thereof, may be used 
analogously to conventional anti-HBs in a homogeneous phase assay for HBsAg. The present invention accordingly 
provides an immunoassay for the detection of HBsAg, which comprises contacting a sample suspected of containing 
HBsAg with a monoclonal antibody of the present invention, a fragment or derivative therof, or a combination of two or 
more thereof, and detecting any resulting antigen-antibody complex. The monoclonal antibody, fragment, derivative or 
combination thereof may be used as the only anti-Hbs reagent or may be used with one or more other anti-HBs antibodies 
selected from polyclonal anti-HBs and other anti-HBs monoclonal antibodies. 
[0064] Immunoassays of various different formats, methods for carrying them out and suitable reagents are a well

known and are described in various textbooks and review articles, for example, Kemeny &amp; Challacome 1988 and Tsu 
&amp; Herzenberg 1980. Any method for the detection of an antigen may be used in the present invention. 
[0065] An assay according to the present invention may be a so-called "sandwich" assay, a competition assay or a 
direct reaction. The monoclonal antibody, fragment, derivative or combination thereof may be immobilised on a solid 
surface alone or in admixture with a polyclonal anti-HBs antiserum and/or with one or more other anti-HBs monoclonal 
antibodies. Alternatively the monoclonal antibody of the invention or the combination thereof and any further antibodies 
may be in a homogeneous phase. Any resulting antibody-antigen complex may be detected using labelled anti-HBs. In 
the case of a heterogeneous phase assay, the anti-HBs used for detection may be the same as or different from that 
used for coating the solid surface. 
[0066] Suitable solid surfaces on which anti-HBs may be immobilized are well known and include the inner walls of 
wells of microtitre plates, beads, particles and so-called "latex". Membranes and strips, for example, of nitrocelluose or 
paper may be used. A membranes or strip may be incorporated in an assay device. Such devices are also well known. 
The invention includes such solid phases on which a monoclonal antibody of the present invention, or a fragment or 
derivative thereof, or a combination of two or more thereof is immobilised. 
[0067] The anti-HBs used for detection of any antigen-antibody complex may be labelled with any agent capable of 
generating a signal directly or indirectly. Such agents are well known. Agents capable of generating a direct signal include 
radiolabels, chromogenic and fluorescent labels. Agents capable of generating a signal indirectly include enzymes 
capable of catalysing a reaction that gives rise to a colour change. 
[0068] The present invention also provides a kit which comprises the components requires to carry out an immunoassay 
of the present invention. Such a kit comprises, for example, a monoclonal antibody of the present invention or a com-
bination of two or more thereof immobilised on a solid surface, together with container (s) comprising other reagent (s) 
required, for example, selected from washing solutions and diluents, standard solutions and control reagents, labelled 
anti-HBs antibodies and, in the case of enzyme-labelled anti-HBs, colour reagents. 
[0069] Often an immunoassay for antibodies to hepatitis B core protein (HBc) is carried out simultaneously with the 
assay for HBs, for example, in the same microwell. The present invention includes the use of a monoclonal antibody of 
the present invention in such assays, and kits and coated solid phases for use with such assays. 
[0070] As indicated above, a monoclonal antibody of the present invention may be used for passive immunisation, for 
example, during liver transplantation of an HBV infected patient. For passive immunisation, the antibody is brought into 
a suitable form for use as an antiserum for parenteral administration, for example, in a form allowing derivatisation 
including humanisation. The dose of antibody to be used will depend on the particular circumstances of each patient 
and will be determined on a case-by-case basis. 
[0071] A monoclonal antibody of the present invention, including combinations of two more such antibodies, fragments 
and derivatives thereof, may be used alone or in addition to other anti-HBs antibodies, either polyclonal or monoclonal. 
Other anti-HBV antibodies may also be included. 
[0072] A mutant form of HBsAg to which a monoclonal antibody of the present invention binds may itself be used as 
an antigen; in the production of monoclonal antibodies; and for screening for putative antibodies according to the present 
invention. Such a mutant HBsAg may be obtained from a subject believed to be harbouring an HBV escape mutant. 
Such a subject will generally be both anti-HBs positive and HBsAg positive. Suitable subjects may be found among 
patients who have received monoclonal antibody therapy for HBV infection, in vaccinated subjects, especially where 
breakthrough infection is found, and in cases of HBV infection that are difficult to diagnose in clinical laboratories using 
current standard tests. 
[0073] A mutant form of HBsAg, for example, one of the mutant forms described above, for example, mutant forms I 
to IV, may be produced by recombinant DNA technology. Naturally occurring DNA encoding the mutant form may be 
inserted into an appropriate host for expression of the mutant HBsAg. Alternatively, wild type DNA may be modified, for 
example, by site-directed mutagenesis, and then used to obtain expression of a mutant form. 
[0074] HBsAg obtained from natural sources, generally from the blood of a selected subject, will have natural glyco-
sylation, and it is generally preferable to use such HBsAg as an antigen. Methods of purifying HBsAg from blood are 
well known, see for example, Cameron et al. 1980. It may be preferable to produce a recombinant mutant HBsAg that 
is partially or fully glycosylated. 
[0075] The HBsAg may be full-length or an appropriate antigenic fragment may be used. Such a fragment may be 
obtained by recombinant technology. Alternatively, a fragment that is an antigenic peptide, for example, produced by 
chemical synthesis may be used. For use as a vaccine, an antigen should be immunogenic ie capable of producing a 
protective response. 
[0076] Methods for producing anti-idiotype antibodies are well known. In the present case a monoclonal antibody of 
the present invention is used as the antigen in the production of an anti-idiotype antibody, and the resulting antibodies 
may be screened against a monoclonal antibody of the present invention. An anti-idiotype antibody of the present 
invention may itself be used as a vaccine, in known manner. 
[0077] The following non-limiting Example illustrates the present invention.

EXAMPLE 

I. MATERIALS AND METHODS 

1: Patients 

[0078] The monoclonal antibodies described below were raised against the mutant HBsAg of two patients. Those 
patients were identified as a result of inconsistent serological markers. 
[0079] Patient MAM was an HBV carrier. The serum was initially, in 1986, HBsAg positive by the polyclonal based 
reverse passive haemagglutination assay (RPH) but negative by a monoclonal enzyme immunoassay (EIA). In 1988 
the patient underwent renal transplantation. When tested again, HBsAg became detectable by both polyclonal and 
monoclonal antibody based assays but reverted to being detectable by polyclonal antibody assay only. The patient's 
serum was anti-HBc and HBsAg positive throughout the period of follow-up. 
[0080] Patient NP underwent renal transplantation in 1985. In 1990 the patient was anti-HBc sero-positive but HBsAg 
and anti-HBs were not detected. Haemodialysis was started in 1993 and later that year HBsAg was detected by polyclonal 
based assays only. 
[0081] Neither of the patients had been previously vaccinated. 
[0082] The sequences of the HBsAg genes around the "a" determinant were determined by single stranded sequencing 
carried out directly on PCR products as is described in Hawkins et al., 1994. 

2: Production Of Monoclonal Antibodies 

2.1: Animals 

[0083] Female Balb/c mice used. 

2.2: Purification of HBsAg 

[0084] Purification of HBsAg required for immunisation of mice was based on the method described by Cameron et 
al., 1980. 
[0085] High titre HBsAg positive serum was fractionated by passing 20ml volumes through a 100x5 cm diameter 
column of Sepharose 6B (Pharmacia Ltd) equilibrated with 0.9% NaCl pH 7.6 buffered with Tris and containing 0.1% 
sodium azide (Tris/Sal/Az). The HBsAg rich fractions, now free of albumin and IgG, were concentrated to a volume of 
9ml by ultrafiltration in a stirred 200ml ultrafiltration cell fitted with an XM 100 A membrane (Amicon Ltd.). To this 2.69g 
of solid CsCl were added and the volume adjusted to 10ml to give a density of 1.2g/cm 3 . The material was then ultra-
centrifuged for three days at 124000g in two 5ml tubes in a SW50-L swinging bucket rotor (Beckman RIIC Ltd) at 20°C 
to give isopyknic banding in the self forming density gradient. 
[0086] The main HBsAg band containing the 22nm small particles was removed from both tubes, pooled and made 
up to 5ml with a solution of CsCl in Tris/Sal/Az (2.885g plus 10ml) which gave a final density of 1.2g/cm 3 . The material 
was ultra-centrifuged under the same conditions as before in one 5ml tube to give the second isopyknic banding. The 
final HBsAg band was removed and dialysed in PBS to remove CsCl. 

3: Immunisation of animals 

[0087] Fifty microlitres of purified NP HBsAg mixed in an equal volume of Titermax adjuvant (Vaxcel, Inc.) were injected 
subcutaneously into a female Balb/c mouse. Approximately two months later a dose of 30 Pl was given intraperitoneally 
(i.p) followed three months later by a 75Pl dose also given i.p.. The final 25 Pl of HBsAg in saline were given intravenously 
three days before the fusion. 
[0088] The same protocol was used when immunising the mouse with the MAM HBsAg. 

4: Culture of Myeloma cells 

[0089] JK cells derived from P3-X63-Ag8653 (Kearney et al., 1979) were cultured in complete medium (see reagents) 
at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 in air atmosphere at 100% humidity. 
[0090] The cells were split 1: 2 approximately three times weekly and maintained at a concentration of between 2x10 5 
and 210 6 cells per ml. Only cells in the log phase of growth were used for fusion to splenocytes. 
[0091] For the fusion, the myeloma cells were spun at 1,500g for 10 minutes and washed three times in the same 
volume of incomplete medium (see Reagents). The resuspended JK cells were diluted 1: 10 in incomplete medium and

the viability and concentration of the cells determined by counting the cells using a Neubauer chamber. The concentration 
of JK cells was found to be approximately 5.87x10 7 cells/ml. 

4.1: Preparation of feeder cells 

[0092] Mouse peritoneal exudate cells were used as a feeder cell layer for hybrid cells. These were prepared the day 
before the fusion was undertaken. Cold complete medium containing hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine (HAT 
medium-see reagents) was used for preparation of the feeder cells. Five milliliters of the medium was injected into the 
peritoneal cavity of a freshly killed Balb/c mouse and after gentle agitation was removed aseptically now containing 
exudate cells. One hundred microlitres of the cells were added to each well of a sterile 96 well plate (4-5 plates were 
needed per spleen to be fused). All plates were examined on the day of the fusion to ensure that they free from any 
visible bacterial or fungal contamination. 

4.2: Preparation of spleen cells 

[0093] Preparation of spleen cells from both MAM HBsAg immunised and the NP HBsAg immunised mice were carried 
out in a similar method. 
[0094] The spleen was carefully removed from the freshly killed mouse and placed in a petri dish containing 5mls of 
cold complete medium. The spleen was disrupted carefully with the blunt side of a scalpel blade thus teasing away the 
cells from the spleen connective tissue. The cell suspension was then transferred to a sterile universal container and 
the debris allowed to settle to the bottom. The supernatant was carefully removed and the cells pelleted at 150g for 10 
minutes. The cells were washed three times in 10ml of incomplete medium and the final cell pellet was resuspended in 
10ml of incomplete medium. The yield and viability of the spleen cells was determined using a Neubauer chamber. 
Approximately 7x10 7 cells were harvested from the NP spleen whilst 10x10 7 cells were obtained from the first MAM 
spleen and 2.5x10 7 cells from the second MAM spleen. 

4.3: Cell fusion 

[0095] The splenocytes were mixed with the myeloma cells at a 4: 1 ratio and the mixture centrifuged at 1500g for 10 
minutes. The supernatant was removed leaving a dry pellet of cells at the bottom the container. This was placed in a 
water bath at 37°C. Polyethylene glycol 1540 (PEG) which had been previously sterilised by autoclaving was also warmed 
in the 37°C waterbath. The cell pellet was loosened in the bottom of the container and 1ml of the PEG solution added 
dropwise whilst the container was gently agitated. The cell/PEG mix was left at 37°C for one minute and then an additional 
2ml of the warm incomplete medium added. Further incomplete medium was added slowly so that the volume doubled 
every minute until 25ml of incomplete medium had been added. The fused cells were then centrifuged at 1500g for 10 
minutes and the pellet resuspended in 10ml of HAT medium. The cell suspension was distributed evenly over five plates 
of feeder cells and then placed in a CO 2 incubator. 

4.4: culture of hybrid cells 

[0096] Clusters of growing fused cells appeared after about a week. At this stage the cells were re-fed by replacing 
100 Pl of old medium with fresh HAT medium. Approximately 14 days after the fusion, 100 Pl of the supernatant fluid 
from each well where successfully fused clusters of cells were found, was removed and assayed for the presence of 
anti-HBs. The supernatant was replaced with complete medium containing hypoxanthine and thymidine (HT medium-
see Reagents). 

4.5: Reverse capture RIA for the detection of anti-HBs secreting hybridomas 

[0097] Supernatant from viable hybridoma cultures were tested for anti-HBs on the basis of a reverse capture assay. 
[0098] Round bottom Nunc microwells were coated with 100 Pl of a 1: 1000 dilution in Tris buffer of the IgG fraction 
of rabbit anti-mouse IgG. After two days at room temperature the wells were washed with Tween Saline and quenched 
for one hour with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in Tris buffer (Tris BSA buffer-see reagents). The wells were then sealed 
and stored moist at 4°C. All washings were done with Tween Saline. 
[0099] Before the assay was carried out, the Tris BSA buffer was removed. One hundred microlitres of a 1: 10 dilution 
in phosphate buffered saline of the supernatant from each well where successfully fused clusters of cells were found 
was added to the assay wells and incubated at 37°C for one hour. After washing, 100 Pl of purified 125 I-wild type HBsAg 
were added and left in a moist box at room temperature overnight. The assay wells were then washed and bound 
reactivity measured in a sixteen channel gammacounter. Supernatant containing anti-HBs gave an increased binding

of the label. The hybridomas were subsequently retested by the same assay using 125 I-MAM and 125 I-NP labels instead 
of 125 I-wild type HBsAg. Each assay carried out included positive and negative controls. Positive controls used were 
monoclonals D2H5 and H3F5 raised against wild type HBsAg. An anti-HIV gag monoclonal 3D3F2 and phosphate 
buffered saline were used as negative controls. 
[0100] From the results of the assay, parent wells containing colonies secreting anti-HBs were chosen for further 
screening and cloning. 
[0101] When the cells were growing well, they were aspirated using a glass pasteur pipette and transferred aseptically 
to 24 well sterile plates which contained a layer of mouse peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) in HT medium. 

4.6: Cloning by limiting dilution 

[0102] Hybridomas identified as anti-HBs positive were cloned by limiting dilution. This is done to ensure that the 
antibody secreted is homogenous and monospecific. For each hybrid culture the volume of cell suspension containing 
100 cells was calculated and this volume added to 10ml of complete medium. One hundred microlitres of this cell 
suspension was added to each of 48 wells of a 96 well plate containing feeder cells in complete medium. One hundred 
more cells were added to the remaining 5ml of complete medium and 100Pl of this more concentrated cell suspension 
were added to 24 wells of the plate. Finally, a further 100 cells were added to the remaining cell suspension and this 
was distributed over the last 24 wells. Variation in the concentration of cells on each plate made allowance for inaccurate 
cell counts and low viability of some cultures. This procedure was repeated for each selected parent hybridoma. 
[0103] Approximately five days after cloning the plates were examined for wells where only a single colony was visible. 
One hundred microlitres of supernatant was removed from these wells and retested for anti-HBs using the reverse 
capture assay described previously. 
[0104] Clones secreting anti-HBs were then expanded as before and re-fed as necessary by removal of 100Pl of 
tissue culture supernatant and replaced with fresh complete medium. 

4.7: Culture of hybrid clones 

[0105] Once the colonies were large enough to cover the well they were expanded into 12cm 2 tissue culture flasks 
containing feeder cells and then further into 25cm 2 and 75cm 2 flasks. The cells were split 1: 2 approximately every 2-3 
days with fresh complete medium. 
[0106] Once good growth had been established, some of the cells were frozen and stored under liquid nitrogen in 
incomplete medium supplemented with 10% dimethyl sulphoxide and 50% foetal calf serum. 

4.8: Production of ascitic fluid 

[0107] Female Balb/c mice, aged 12-20 weeks were primed with 0.5ml pristane. One to four weeks after priming, 1ml 
of cloned hybridoma cells, resuspended in incomplete medium, were injected intraperitoneally. The ascitic fluid was 
aspirated 1-3 weeks later and separated from cells by centrifugation at 3000g for 10 minutes. The ascitic fluid was then 
stored at -20°C. 

II. CHARACTERISATION OF THE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES RAISED AGAINST WILD TYPE AND MUTANT 
HBsAg 

1: Isotyping of monoclonal antibodies 

[0108] Isotyping of the monoclonal antibodies was carried out using a kit from Serotec (Serotech Limited, 22 Bankside 
Station Approach, Kidlington, Oxfords OX5 1BR) specifically designed to identify the class and subclass of monoclonal 
antibodies in tissue culture supernatants. Used in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations, it readily 
characterised the mouse monoclonal antibody. 

2: Serum protein electrophoresis 

[0109] Ascitic fluid from each clone was tested for the presence of a monoclonal protein band by serum protein 
electrophoresis (SPE, Paragon Electrophoresis System, Beckman Ltd). Following the protocol provided, the kit conven-
iently identified those ascitic fluids containing high levels of monoclonal immunoglobulin. 
[0110] The Paragon Serum Protein Electrophoresis kit is intended for the electrophoretic separation of proteins in a 
buffered agarose gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins in the gel were immobilised in a fixative solution and the gel 
dried to a film. The protein pattern is visualised by staining the film with a protein-specific stain and the pattern visually

interpreted. 

3: Immunoglobulin G preparation 

[0111] Immunoglobulin G was prepared by ion exchange chromatography from the various ascitic fluids. 
[0112] DE52 gel (Whatman Ltd), supplied pre-swollen was resuspended in a 0.2M phosphate buffer pH 8.0. The gel 
was then dispersed in distilled water to give a 10mM buffer strength. 
[0113] A K9 column (Pharmacia) was packed with the DE52 gel to give a gel to sample volume ratio of 5: 1. All columns 
were equilibrated with an equal volume of 10mM phosphate buffer (PB-see reagents). After overnight dialysis at 4°C in 
10mM PB, the sample was layered on top of the columns and allowed to absorb over 30 minutes. 
[0114] Immunoglobulin G from the ascitic fluid was recovered by stepwise elution with 10mM, 30mM and 60mM PB. 
Each buffer was allowed to run through the column and the optical density of the eluent was monitored and recorded at 
280nm (Ultra Violet Spectrophotometre, LKB Ltd.). The three different eluents were collected separately and assayed 
for anti-HBs activity in the reverse capture RIA. The eluent containing the majority of anti-HBs reactivity could be identified. 
[0115] The protein concentrations of the ascitic fluid IgG were calculated by determining their absorbance at 280nm 
using an E1% 1cm value of 1.4 in a spectrophotometer. 

4: Immunoglobulin A preparation 

[0116] As with IgG, IgA was prepared using ion exchange chromatography. Separation was, however, carried out on 
a Sephacryl gel. As with DE52, the gel was equilibrated with 10mM phosphate buffer. The sample was layered on top 
of the column and allowed to absorb over 30 minutes. As before, the ascitic fluid was separated by stepwise elution. 
The eluent was monitored and then tested for anti-HBs reactivity. 

5: Radiolabelling procedure 

[0117] Labelling of the immunoglobulin fractions was carried out by the iodogen method (Salacinski et al., 1979). 
[0118] Clean 7.5x10cm glass tubes were initially coated with 5Pg of chloroform. To the iodogen tubes 15Pg of protein 
in PBS was added. Finally Na 125 I (0.5 miCi, Amersham International Plc) was added and the reaction in the tube allowed 
to proceed for 10 minutes on ice. The iodogen acts as a mild oxidising agent for the Na 125 I to bind onto a tyrosine residue 
on the protein. 
[0119] A K9 column was then packed with Sephadex G-25 and equilibrated in Tris BSA buffer. Non-radioactive iodide 
(KI/NaI) in PBS was added to the G25 column as this reduced the tendency for free 125 I to stick to the column. The 
reaction mixture was then removed from the iodogen tube and transferred to the column. Tris BSA buffer was then used 
for eluting and the eluent monitored. The 125 I-labelled protein fraction was collected from the first peak and stopped as 
the peak began to tail off. The labelled protein was then stored at 4°C in Tris saline buffer containing 5% BSA. 
[0120] Elution was continued until free 125 I had come through (i.e. the second peak). The height of this peak compared 
to the height of the first peak gave an estimate of the percentage of 125 I bound. 

III. RESULTS 

1: Patients 

[0121] The sera from both patients MAM and NP were tested in a series of assays for HBsAg. Results of the comparison 
of monoclonal and polyclonal antibody based methods is shown in Table 1 below.

[0122] Results from the sequencing revealed several point mutations in the "a" determinant of both patients. Mutations 
were found in HBV DNA amplified from patient NP (subtype ayw) at surface antigen codons encoding amino acids 133, 
134 and 144. Mutations were found at codons encoding amino acids 133, 134, 142; 144 and 145 in HBV DNA amplified 
from patient MAM (subtype adr). Those mutations were detected both before and after transplantation. The sequences 
did not differ between the period when HBsAg was detectable by either polyclonal antibody based assays alone as 
compared with the time when HBsAg was detectable by both monoclonal and polyclonal based assays. The mutations 
are shown in Table 2. 
[0123] MAM HBsAg is Mutant HBsAg I and NPHBsAg is Mutant HBsAg II. The complete amino acid sequence of, 
and nucleotide sequence encoding, HBsAg is given in Valenzuela et al. (1979). 

2: Identification and distribution of anti-HBs secreting monoclonal antibodies 

[0124] Hybridomas secreting anti-HBs were initially identified by using the reverse capture assay (see section II, 4.5). 
Approximately a week after the fusion all wells containing clusters of growing cells were tested for anti-HBs activity. 
Every assay performed included both negative and positive controls. 
[0125] Cells arising from the MAM fusion were tested in the RIA in the first instance with the 125 I MAM HBsAg whilst 
those from the NP fusion were tested with the 125 I NP HBsAg. Results of the assay would give an indication of those 
clones which were producing antibodies against their respective surface antigens. Hybridomas which gave counts above 
750cpm were considered to be positive. It was shown that of the 320 MAM clones tested, 10% were positive whilst 8% 
of the 200 NP clones were found to be positive. 
[0126] To check for any reactivity against the wild type (WT) HBsAg, clones from both the NP and MAM fusions, 
regardless of whether they were positive in the previous assay were tested in the reverse capture RIA using 125 I WT 
HBsAg label. As before, a positive result was indicated by an increased binding of the label. Hybridomas which gave 
counts over 650cpm were considered as positive. Of the 320 MAM clones tested, 6% gave positive results whilst 4% of 
the NP clones were found to bind to the 125 I WT HBsAg. 
[0127] With the results obtained thus far it was possible to identify those clones secreting anti-HBs which was specifically 
recognising and therefore binding either MAM, NP or WT hepatitis B surface antigen. 
[0128] To determine if there was any cross reactivity within these hybridomas the NP clones were tested with 125 I 
MAM HBsAg and the MAM clones with the 125 I NP HBsAg. It was found that 4 of the MAM clones recognised NP label 
whilst 5 of the NP clones were recognised by the MAM label. 
[0129] The clones had now been tested with all label combinations. It was therefore possible to identify those hybri-
domas which had consistently given strong positive results be it with the 125 I MAM, 125 I NP or 125 I WT HBsAg. The

monoclonal antibodies could now be divided into the following categories: 1) MAM specific; 2) NP specific; 3) MAM/NP 
specific; 4) MAM/WT specific; 5) NP/WT specific; 6) NP/WT/MAM specific. 
[0130] Eight NP and ten MAM parent hybridomas each of which fell under one of the categories listed above were 
chosen. These hybridomas were chosen as they displayed good cell growth as well as being repeatedly positive when 
tested for anti-HBs activity. 
[0131] The eighteen chosen hybridomas were then cloned by limiting dilution. Approximately fourteen days after 
cloning, wells containing single colonies were tested in the reverse capture assay with all three of the labels. Six of the 
eight NP hybridomas cloned successfully and were found to be still positive for anti-HBs activity. 
[0132] However, with the MAM clones, it was found that only six of the ten chosen hybridomas cloned. Attempts at 
recloning the hybridomas from their respective parent colonies proved unsuccessful despite increasing the concentration 
of the cells added to each plate. The six successfully cloned hybridomas containing single colonies were tested for anti-
HBs activity. From the six, two hybridomas, M3C9 and M3A10, both three way crosses were found to be still positive 
for anti-HBs. Hybridomas derived from the MAM fusion were proving to be extremely unstable as they were passaged. 
[0133] At least three positive clones were chosen from each hybridoma for expansion. The clones were propagated 
in culture and retested two weeks later. All the NP clones were still positive for anti-HBs secretion. However of the MAM 
clones, M3C9 had also proved to be extremely unstable giving negative results in the RIA. 
[0134] The final positive secreting hybridomas from each fusion are shown in Table 3 below. The table also gives the 
monoclonal antibody specificity and their RIA values rounded up to the nearest 500cpm. 

[0135] A second MAM fusion was undertaken. The fusion was carried out as described before. However, the yield of 
spleen cells was only 25% of that recorded in the original MAM fusion. Approximately a week later, all wells containing 
clusters of growing cells were tested for anti-HBs activity using the reverse capture RIA. As before, each assay performed 
included negative and positive controls. All cells arising from the fusion were tested with each of the labels, 125 I MAM 
HBsAg, 125 I NP HBsAg and 125 I WT HBsAg. 
[0136] Of the 68 cloned tested, only three produced positive results. One clone was found to be MAM specific whilst 
the other two, M4H2 and M4F5, were found to be WT/NP/MAM crosses (Table 4). However, as described in more detail 
below, M4H2 proved to be unstable, like some of the hybridomas from the first MAM fusion. It eventually stabilised as 
a MAM-specific clone.

[0137] All three of the hybridomas displayed good cell growth and were cloned by limiting dilution. Cloning on this 
occasion proved successful and all wells containing single colonies were tested in the reverse capture RIA with all three 
of the labels. The clones were still found to be positive for anti-HBs activity. 
[0138] Five positive clones were chosen for expansion. After further growth in culture, the clones were screened and 
found to be still positive for anti-HBs production. 
[0139] The final number of positive parent hybridomas and their antibody specificity and cross-reactivity obtained from 
the NP and the two MAM fusions are shown in Table 5. 

[0140] Further cross-competition studies were carried out using antibodies P2D3, M4F5 and M3A10 with WT, NP and 
MAM HBsAg. Each of those antibodies cross-competed with each other, but did not cross-compete with any of the other 
monoclonal antibodies raised. At this stage M4H2 still appeared to be a three-way cross. 
[0141] These results further indicate that the monoclonal antibodies of the invention bind to a distinct epitope. 
[0142] One positive clone from each hybridoma parent was chosen and injected into a previously pristane primed 
Balb/c mouse. One to three weeks after the intraperitoneal inoculation, the ascitic fluid was harvested from the mice. 
All clones successfully produced ascitic tumours in the mice. The quantity of ascitic fluid obtained from each mouse 
varied from 1ml to 5ml. 
[0143] More extensive cross-competition studies were carried out using various different antibodies, each with WT, 
MAM and NP HBsAg. Those tests were carried out according to the reverse capture RIA protocol given above with the 
following modifications: the microwells were coated with a goat polyclonal anti-HBs antibody. In each case 100 Pl of the 
antigen were added and incubated overnight, then 50 Pl each of 125 I labelled and unlabelled monoclonal antibody were 
added and binding was determined. The results are presented in Tables 6a, 6b and 6c. In those Tables, the labelled 
antibodies are listed horizontally and the unlabelled antibodies are listed vertically.

[0144] The results shown in Tables 6a, 6b and 6c confirm that the three-way cross antibodies M4F5 and P2D3 are 
binding to a common epitope. 
[0145] M3A10 was found previously to be a three-way cross antibody (see Table 4). The fact that it is an IgA antibody 
(see Section III. 4 below) may explain the poor binding results shown in Table 6a since this class of antibody (IgA) is 
difficult to purify. 
[0146] As shown above, the hybridoma M4H2, which was produced in the second MAM fusion, was initially found to 
be a three-way cross (see Table 4). However, after further growth in culture, that hybridoma showed decreasing binding 
to 125 I WT HBsAg and to 125 I NP HBsAg. Retesting for anti-HBs activity against the WT and NP HBsAg over a period 
of time revealed negative results. However, M4H2 continued to recognise and bind strongly to the 125 I MAM HBsAg. It 
appears therefore, that the clone specificity was initially unstable and with the passage of time has evolved to a MAM-
specific antibody-secreting hybridoma. 
[0147] Binding of 125 I-labelled antibodies to various different HBsAgs was measured using a RIA in which HBsAg was 
immobilised to the solid phase (microwells) via a polyclonal goat anti-HBs coated on the microwells. The HBsAgs used 
were WT, MAM and NP HBsAg, which have been described above, SP HBsAg and SZ HBsAg. SP HBsAg, which is 
serotype adw, has a mutation in the codon for amino acid 143 leading to substitution of met for ser. In SZ HBsAg, 
serotype adr, a mutation leads to substitution of arg for gly at position 145. (SP HBsAg is Mutant HBsAg IV and SZ 
HBsAg is Mutant HBsAg III.) A pool of normal human sera that has been tested and found to be hepatitis B marker free 
(NHS) was used as control. This is an example of an immunoassay according to the present invention. The results are 
presented in Table 7 below. 

[0148] These results show that the three-way cross antibodies detect wild type HBsAg and also HBsAg from various 
different mutants, including mutant HBsAg different from that used for screening the antibodies. These results further 
confirm that the three-way cross antibodies are binding to an epitope common to the wild type protein and to mutant 
forms and demonstrate the utility of the antibodies in HBsAg assays. Using such antibodies it is possible to detect the 
presence of escape mutants. 

3: Isotyping of monoclonal antibodies 

[0149] Isotyping of the monoclonal antibodies was carried out using a kit from Serotec. Each isotyping reagent consisted 
of a purified rat monoclonal antibody specific for a single class-subclass of immunoglobulin, coupled to sheep red blood 
cells. The coupled rat antibodies recognised the heavy chain portion of the mouse immunoglobulin. The principle of the 
test system was based on red cell agglutination where a positive agglutinated result was produced when highly specific 
antibody recognised and bound to the particular isotype to which it is directed. The binding formed a lattice on the bottom 
of the microtitre plate well. A negative result was produced when the reagent cells were put into a supernatant containing 
a class of antibody which they did not recognise. The reagent cells fell to the bottom of the well forming a small "button". 
[0150] The isotype of the monoclonal antibodies are shown in Table 8.

4: SPE analysis and purification of anti-HBs from ascitic fluid 

[0151] Monoclonal protein was demonstrated in the ascitic fluid of all of the clones by serum protein electrophoresis. 
The electrophoretic mobility of the monoclonal protein band varied slightly for each different monoclonal ascitic fluid, but 
was identical for different batches of ascitic fluid obtained from the same clone. The disparity in migration distance 
between clones was a result of the differing ionic charges on the monoclonal proteins. The intensity of staining observed 
in the SPE monoclonal band gave an indication of the quantity of monoclonal protein present. This varied between ascitic 
fluid which had been harvested from different clones. A SPE band, however, was not seen with M4B12, the MAM specific 
monoclonal antibody. When the recovered ascitic fluid was tested in the RIA for anti-HBs activity, a negative result was 
given; all the other ascitic fluids gave the expected positive results. As before the MAM specific monoclonal antibody 
was proving to be unstable changing from a positive secreting hybridoma to a negative. (The M4B12 parent hybridoma 
has since been recloned and will be retested). 
[0152] Preparation of immunoglobulin from the ascitic fluids was carried out as described in sections III, 3 and III, 4 
above. Immunoglobulin G was prepared by ion exchange chromatography on DE52 whilst IgA was separated on a 
Sephacryl column. Three separate protein peaks were obtained when increasing the ionic strength from 10mM to 30mM 
and finally 60mM PB for each monoclonal ascitic fluid. The size of the peaks varied from one monoclonal fluid to another. 
Eluent was collected at each peak. The anti-HBs IgG/IgA in the different buffer concentrations were then measured in 
the reverse capture assay with 125 I MAM HBsAg, 125 I NP HBsAg and 125 I WT HBsAg. The assay allowed a direct 
comparison of results between different buffer fractions to be made. From the assay, it was possible to choose the 
fraction showing the highest anti-HBs activity. The protein concentrations of the chosen fractions were determined (Table 
9). The quantity of IgG/IgA obtained from each monoclonal antibody varied between each batch of ascitic fluid harvested.

[0153] The intensity of the monoclonal band staining in SPE showed strong positive correlation to the protein concen-
tration results in Table 7. For example P4C11 showed a very darkly stained band in SPE and had a high protein 
concentration whilst P2H9 showed a faintly stained band and had a low protein concentration. 

GENERAL DISCUSSION 

[0154] The results of HBsAg detection assays have confirmed that as a result of mutations, HBsAg in serum may not 
be detected by some monoclonal antibody based systems. Such mutations may cause the failure of either the capture 
antibody or the conjugated detection antibody to bind. These results show the importance of testing for a second marker 
in suspected cases of HBV infections when the initial screening test for HBsAg is negative. Both NP and MAM would 
have shown an anti-HBc only profile if tested for HBsAg with a monoclonal-based assay. The presence of HBsAg in the 
samples was revealed on testing by polyclonal based systems. 
[0155] A mutation at amino acid 145 (glycine to lysine) was detected in patient MAM. Although this mutation was 
different from that previously described in vaccine escape mutants (glycine to arginine), the amino acid substitution was 
such that the predicted effect on the antigen structure is similar. 
[0156] Patient NP did not have a mutation at codon 145 but multiple mutations as with patient MAM. Which of the 
mutations is responsible for the loss of detectability has not been determined. Interestingly in patient MAM the nucleotide 
sequences did not vary with change in HBsAg specificity in the HBsAg detection assays. This may have been due to 
the emergence of wild type virus present at less than 15-20% of the total viral load, the limit of detection by direct 
sequence analysis. 
[0157] The production of monoclonal antibodies against the mutant hepatitis B surface antigens was successful. The 
number of clones produced in the NP and initial MAM fusion and the relative distribution of the specificities of the resulting 
antibodies were favourable. In order to identify anti-HBs secreting hybridomas, a sensitive but quick screening assay 
was required. An IgG reverse capture radioimmunoassay was chosen. The assay, though simple to set up, is capable 
of a very low background and a large dynamic range. The relative binding by positive clones of the labelled wild type 
and mutant HBsAg were unambiguously high and consistent giving reliable results. 
[0158] Screening the hybridomas was initially carried out testing those clones derived from the MAM fusion with 125 I 
MAM HBsAg and the NP clones with 125 I NP HBsAg. Results of this assay gave an indication of those clones specifically 
producing anti-HBs which were recognising and thus binding to the MAM HBsAg or the NP HBsAg. All clones produced 
as a result of the two fusions were then tested with 125 I WT HBsAg. No single clone gave a positive reaction to the WT 
HBsAg only. Either MAM/WT crosses or NP/WT crosses were found. 
[0159] It was therefore possible to identify those clones which were recognising the MAM HBsAg or the NP HBsAg. 
Those clones which were also binding to the NP and WT HBsAg were also identified. To test for any cross reactivity 
between the hybridomas the clones produced from the MAM fusion were tested with the 125 I NP HBsAg and vice versa. 
As a result of the screening assays, it was possible to categorise the clones as is listed in the Results section. 
[0160] Positive controls included in the assay were two known WT HBsAg monoclonal antibodies, H3F5 and D2H5 
whilst negative controls were PBS and 3D3F2, an anti-HIV gag monoclonal. As expected when used in the 125 I WT 
HBsAg RIA, both H3F5 and D2H5 gave strong positive results. However when tested against 125 I MAM HBsAg only 
H3F5 gave a positive reading and was negative when tested with 125 I NP HBsAg. D2H5 though produced a positive 
signal with 125 I NP HBsAg but was very weak when tested against 125 I MAM HBsAg. Mutations in the MAM HBsAg 
eliminated the epitope for D2H5 whilst those in the NP HBsAg eliminated the H3F5 epitope. 
[0161] The results obtained on testing with the SP and SZ mutant HBsAg show that the three-way cross antibodies 
are capable of detecting other mutant forms of HBsAg in addition to those used in the screening process. This confirms 
that the antibodies are binding to an epitope that is conserved between the wild type protein and mutant forms, and 
thereby confirms the value of including such antibodies in an HBsAg assay. 
[0162] Although some of the hybridomas from the MAM fusions proved to be unstable, sucessful three-way crosses 
were obtained readily from both the MAM and NP fusions. Mutant forms of HBsAg other than the MAM and NP forms 
may be used for raising and/or for screening monoclonal antibodies according to the protocols described above.

Description 

FIELD OF THE INVENTION 

[0001] The present invention provides novel proteins which show homology to interleukin-10 (IL-10) and polynucle-
otides encoding such proteins, along with therapeutic, diagnostic and research utilities for these polynucleotides and 
proteins. 

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 

[0002] Technology aimed at the discovery of protein factors (including e.g., cytokines, such as lymphokines, interferons, 
CSFs and interleukins) has matured rapidly over the past decade. The now routine hybridization cloning and expression 
cloning techniques clone novel polynucleotides "directly" in the sense that they rely on information directly related to the 
discovered protein (i.e., partial DNA/ amino acid sequence of the protein in the case of hybridization cloning; activity of 
the protein in the case of expression cloning). More recent "indirect" cloning techniques such as signal sequence cloning, 
which isolates DNA sequences based on the presence of a now well-recognized secretory leader sequence motif, as 
well as various PCR-based or low stringency hybridization cloning techniques, have advanced the state of the art by 
making available large numbers of DNA/ amino acid sequences for proteins that are known to have biological activity by 
virtue of their secreted nature in the case of leader sequence cloning, or by virtue of the cell or tissue source in the case 
of PCR-based techniques. It is to these proteins and the polynucleotides encoding them that the present invention is 
directed. 

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 

[0003] In one embodiment, the present invention provides an isolated polynucleotide selected from the group consisting 
of:

(c) a polynucleotide comprising the nucleotide sequence of a full-length protein coding sequence of clone hGIL-
19/AE289 deposited under accession number ATCC 207231; 

(d) a polynucleotide comprising the nucleotide sequence of a mature protein coding sequence of clone hGIL-
19/AE289 deposited under accession number ATCC 207231; 

(e) a polynucleotide encoding a protein comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2; 

(f) a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 from about

19/AE289 deposited under accession number ATCC 207231 (e.g., nucleotides 1-1177 of SEQ ID NO: 1). In other preferred 
embodiments, the polynucleotide encodes the full-length or a mature protein encoded by the cDNA insert of clone hGIL-
19/AE289 deposited under accession number ATCC 207231 (e.g., amino acids 1-179 of SEQ ID NO: 2). Also described

of SEQ ID NO: 2 having biological activity, the fragment comprising the amino acid sequence from amino acid 84 to 
amino acid 93 of SEQ ID NO: 2. 
[0005] Other embodiments provide the gene corresponding to the cDNA sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 

Isolated Proteins and Polynucleotides 

[0018] Nucleotide and amino acid sequences, as presently determined, are reported below for each clone and protein 
disclosed in the present application. The nucleotide sequence of each clone can readily be determined by sequencing 
of the deposited clone in accordance with known methods. The predicted amino acid sequence (both full-length and 
mature forms) can then be determined from such nucleotide sequence. The amino acid sequence of the protein encoded 
by a particular clone can also be determined by expression of the clone in a suitable host cell, collecting the protein and 
determining its sequence. 
[0019] As used herein a "secreted" protein is one which, when expressed in a suitable host cell, is transported across 
or through a membrane, including transport as a result of signal sequences in its amino acid sequence. "Secreted" 
proteins include without limitation proteins secreted wholly (e.g., soluble proteins) or partially (e.g. , receptors) from the 
cell in which they are expressed. "Secreted" proteins also include without limitation proteins which are transported across 
the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. 

Clone "hGIL-19/AE289" 

[0020] A polynucleotide of the present invention has been identified initially as clone "hTIF/AE289", later renamed and 
referred to herein also as "hGIL-19/AE289" and "hGIL-19". Clone hGIL-19/AE289 was isolated according to the following 
method. A murine EST was identified from a murine cDNA library made from splenocytes activated with both ConA and 
bone marrow derived dendritic cells. The EST was identified using methods which are selective for cDNAs encoding 
secreted proteins (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,536,637). The murine EST sequence was used to isolate a full-length murine 


EP 1 177 312 B1

5 





















clone from the same cDNA library (SEQ ID NO: 4; Figure 1 depicts the sequence of the murine GIL-19 cDNA). Analysis 
of the sequence of the murine clone revealed a significant homology to interleukin-10 (IL-10). 
[0021] In order to isolate a human homolog of the murine clone, PCR primers were constructed based upon the region 
of the murine sequence which showed homology to IL-10. Use of such primers for amplification in a human PBMC library 
produced a PCR product of significant size. Analysis of the sequence of the PCR product confirmed that it was a homolog 
of the murine cDNA. Oligonucleotides were constructed from the sequence of the partial human clone and used to isolate 
a full-length human clone from the PBMC library. 
[0022] hGIL-19/AE289 is a full-length human clone, including the entire coding sequence of a secreted protein (also 
referred to herein as "hTIF/AE289 protein," "hGIL-19/AE289 protein" and "hGIL-19 protein"). Analysis of its sequence 
confirms its homology to IL-10. 
[0023] The nucleotide sequence of hGIL-19 as presently determined is reported in SEQ ID NO: 1, and includes a poly 
(A) tail. The open reading frame and the amino acid sequence of full-length hGIL-19 protein corresponding to the foregoing 
nucleotide sequence is reported in SEQ ID NO: 2. The amino acid sequence of mature hGIL-19 corresponds to amino 
acids 34-179 of SEQ ID NO: 2. 
[0024] Clone "hGIL-19/AE289" was deposited on April 28, 1999 with the American Type Culture Collection (10801 
University Boulevard, Manassas, Virginia 20110-2209 U.S.A.) as an original deposit under the Budapest Treaty and 
was given the accession number ATCC 207231. All restrictions on the availability to the public of the deposited material 
will be irrevocably removed upon the granting of the patent, except for the requirements specified in 37 C.F.R.  § 1.808 
(b), and the term of the deposit Will comply with 37 C.F.R.  § 1.806. 
[0025] Fragments of the proteins of the present invention (e.g. fragments which are capable of exhibiting biological 
activity) are also encompassed by the present invention. Fragments of the protein may be in linear form or they may be 
cyclized using known methods, for example, as described in H.U. Saragovi, et al., Bio/ Technology 10, 773-778 (1992) 
and in R.S. McDowell, et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 114, 9245-9253 (1992). Such fragments may be fused to carrier 
molecules such as immunoglobulins for many purposes, including increasing the valency of protein binding sites. For 
example, fragments of the protein may be fused through "linker" sequences to the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin. For 
a bivalent form of the protein, such a fusion could be to the Fc portion of an 1gG molecule. Other immunoglobulin isotypes 
may also be used to generate such fusions. For example, a protein -IgM fusion would generate a decavalent form of 
the protein of the invention. 
[0026] The present invention also provides both full-length and mature forms of the disclosed proteins. The full-length 
form of the such proteins is identified in the sequence listing by translation of the nucleotide sequence of each disclosed 
clone. The mature form (s) of such protein may be obtained by expression of the disclosed full-length polynucleotide 
(preferably those deposited with ATCC) in a suitable mammalian cell or other host cell. The sequence (s) of the mature 
form (s) of the protein may also be determinable from the amino acid sequence of the full-length form and are set forth 
herein, for example as amino acids 1-179 of SEQ ID NO: 2. 
[0027] The present invention also provides genes corresponding to the polynucleotide sequences disclosed herein. 
"Corresponding genes" are the regions of the genome that are transcribed to produce the mRNAs from which cDNA 
polynucleotide sequences are derived and may include contiguous regions of the genome necessary for the regulated 
expression of such genes. Corresponding genes may therefore include buT are not limited to coding sequences, 5' and 
3' untranslated regions, alternatively spliced exons, introns, promoters, enhancers, and silencer or suppressor elements. 
The corresponding genes can be isolated in accordance with known methods using the sequence information disclosed 
herein. Such methods include the preparation of probes or primers from the disclosed sequence information for identi-
fication and/or amplification of genes in appropriate genomic libraries or other sources of genomic materials. An "isolated 
gene" is a gene that has been separated from the adjacent coding sequences, if any, present in the genome of the 
organism from which the gene was isolated. 
[0028] The chromosomal location corresponding to the polynucleotide sequences disclosed herein may also be de-
termined, for example by hybridizing appropriately labeled polynucleotides of the present invention to chromosomes in 
situ. It may also be possible to determine the corresponding chromosomal location for a disclosed polynucleotide by 
identifying significantly similar nucleotide sequences in public databases, such as expressed sequence tags (ESTs), 
that have already been mapped to particular chromosomal locations. For at least some of the polynucleotide sequences 
disclosed herein, public database sequences having at least some similarity to the polynucleotide of the present invention 
have been listed by database accession number. Searches using the GenBank accession numbers of these public 
database sequences can then be performed at an Internet site provided by the National Center for Biotechnology 
Information having the address http: //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ UniGene/, in order to identify "UniGene clusters" of over-
lapping sequences. Many of the "UniGene clusters" so identified will already have been mapped to particular chromosomal 
sites. 
[0029] Organisms that have enhanced, reduced, or modified expression of the gene (s) corresponding to the polynu-
cleotide sequences disclosed herein are provided. The desired change in gene expression can be achieved through the 
use of antisense polynucleotides or ribozymes that bind and/or cleave the mRNA transcribed from the gene (Albert and

Morris, 1994, Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 15 (7): 250-254; Lavarosky et al., 1997, Biochem. Mol. Med 62 (1): 11-22; and 
Hampel, 1998, Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 58: 1-39. Non-human transgenic animals that have multiple copies of 
the gene (s) corresponding to the polynucleotide sequences disclosed herein, preferably produced by transformation of 
cells with genetic constructs that are stably maintained within the transformed cells and their progeny, are provided. 
Non-human transgenic animals that have modified genetic control regions that increase or reduce gene expression 
levels, or that change temporal or spatial patterns of gene expression, are also provided (see European Patent No. 0 
649 464 B1). In addition, non-human organisms are provided in which the gene (s) corresponding to the polynucleotide 
sequences disclosed herein have been partially or completely inactivated, through insertion of extraneous sequences 
into the corresponding gene (s) or through deletion of all or part of the corresponding gene (s). Partial or complete gene 
inactivation can be accomplished through insertion, preferably followed by imprecise excision, of transposable elements 
(Plasterk, 1992, Bioessays 14 (9): 629-633; Zwaal et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad.Sci. USA 90 (16): 7431-7435; Clark et 
al., 1994, Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 91 (2): 719-722), or through homologous recombination, preferably detected by 
positive/ negative genetic selection strategies (Mansour et al., 1988, Nature 336: 348-352; U.S. Patent Nos. 5,464,764; 
5,487,992; 5,627,059; 5,631,153; 5,614, 396; 5,616,491; and 5,679,523). These organisms with altered gene expression 
are preferably eukaryotes and more preferably are non-human mammals. Such organisms are useful for the development 
of non-human models for the study of disorders involving the corresponding gene (s), and for the development of assay 
systems for the identification of molecules that interact with the protein product (s) of the corresponding gene (s). 
[0030] Proteins and protein fragments described herein include proteins with amino acid sequence lengths that are 
at least 25% (more preferably at least 50%, and most preferably at least 75%) of the length of a disclosed protein and 
have at least 60% sequence identity (more preferably, at least 75% identity; most preferably at least 90% or 95% identity) 
with that disclosed protein, where sequence identity is determined by comparing the amino acid sequences of the proteins 
when aligned so as to maximize overlap and identity while minimizing sequence gaps. Also included are proteins and 
protein fragments that contain a segment preferably comprising 8 or more (more preferably 20 or more, most preferably 
30 or more) contiguous amino acids that shares at least 75% sequence identity (more preferably, at least 85% identity; 
most preferably at least 95% identity) with any such segment of any of the disclosed proteins. 
[0031] In one embodiment, proteins, protein fragments, and recombinant proteins of the present invention include 
those which can be identified based on the presence of at least one "HGIL-19/AE299 receptor-binding motif." As used 
herein, the term "hGIL-19/AE289 receptor-binding motif" includes amino acid sequences or residues which are important 
for binding of hGIL-19 to its requisite receptor. In a preferred embodiment, a hGIL-19 protein contains a hGIL-19/AE289 
receptor-binding motif including about amino acids 50-60 of SEQ ID NO: 2. In another embodiment, a GIL-19 protein 
contains a hGIL-19/AE289 receptor-binding motif including about amino acids 63-81 of SEQ ID NO: 2. In yet another 
embodiment, a GIL-19 protein contains a hGIL-19/AE289 receptor-binding motif including about amino acids 168-177 
of SEQ ID NO: 2. In a preferred embodiment, a GIL-19 protein contains a hGIL-19/AE289 receptor-binding motif including 
at least one of amino acids 50-60, amino acids 63-81, and/or about amino acids 168-177 of SEQ ID NO: 2. 
[0032] In yet another embodiment, a hGIL-19/AE289 receptor binding motif has an amino acid sequence at least 95%, 
96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or more identical to an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of amino acids 
50-60 of SEQ ID NO: 2, amino acids 63-81 of SEQ ID NO: 2, and amino acids 168-177 of SEQ ID NO: 2. 
[0033] In another embodiment, proteins, protein fragments, and recombinant proteins of the present invention include 
those which can be identified based on the presence of at least one, two, three, four or more sites for N-linked glycosylation. 
[0034] In particular, sequence identity may be determined using WU-BLAST (Washington University BLAST) version 
2.0 software, which builds upon WU-BLAST version 1.4, which in turn is based on the public domain NCBI-BLAST 
version 1.4 (Altschul and Gish, 1996, Local alignment statistics, Doolittle ed., Methods in Enzymology 266: 460-480;

R can be used in order to align sequences so as to maximize overlap and identity while minimizing sequence gaps. The 
default amino acid comparison matrix is BLOSUM62, but other amino acid comparison matrices such as PAM can be 
utilized. 
[0035] Species homologues of the disclosed polynucleotides and proteins are also described herein. As used herein, 
a "species homologue" is a protein or polynucleotide with a different species of origin from that of a given protein or 
polynucleotide, but with significant sequence similarity to the given protein or polynucleotide. Preferably, polynucleotide 
species homologues have at least 60% sequence identity (more preferably, at least 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 99%) 
with the given polynucleotide, and protein species homologues have at least 30% sequence identity (more preferably, 
at least 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%) with the given protein, where sequence identity is 
determined by comparing the nucleotide sequences of the polynucleotides or the amino acid sequences of the proteins 
when aligned so as to maximize overlap and identity while minimizing sequence gaps. Species homologues may be 
isolated and identified by making suitable probes or primers from the sequences provided herein and screening a suitable 
nucleic acid source from the desired species. Preferably, species homologues are those isolated from mammalian 
species. Most preferably, species homologues are those isolated from certain mammalian species such as, for example, 
Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus, Hylobates concolor, Macaca mulatta, Papio papio, Papio hamadryas, 
Cercopithecus aethiops, Cebus capucinus, Aotus trivirgarus, Sanguinus oedipus, Microcebus murinus, Mus musculus, 
Rattus norvegicus, Cricetulus griseus, Felis catus, Mustela vison, Canis familiaris, Oryctolagus cuniculus, Bos taurus, 
Ovis aries, Sus scrofa, and Equus caballus, for which genetic maps have been created allowing the identification of 
syntenic relationships between the genomic organization of genes in one species and the genomic organization of the 
related genes in another species (O'Brien and Seuánez, 1988, Ann. Rev. Genet. 22: 323-351; O'Brien et al., 1993, 
Nature Genetics 3: 103-112; Johansson et al., 1995, Genomics 25: 682-690; Lyons et al., 1997, Nature Genetics 15: 
47-56; O'Brien et al., 1997, Trends in Genetics 13 (10): 393-399; Carver and Stubbs, 1997, Genome Research 7: 
1123-1137). 
[0036] Also described herein are allelic variants of the disclosed polynucleotides or proteins; that is, naturally-occurring 
alternative forms of the isolated polynucleotides which also encode proteins which are identical or have significantly 
similar sequences to those encoded by the disclosed polynucleotides. Preferably, allelic variants have at least 60% 
sequence identity (more preferably, at least 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 99%) with the given polynucleotide, where 
sequence identity is determined by comparing the nucleotide sequences of the polynucleotides when aligned so as to 
maximize overlap and identity while minimizing sequence gaps. Allelic variants may be isolated and identified by making 
suitable probes or primers from the sequences provided herein and screening a suitable nucleic acid source from 
individuals of the appropriate species. 
[0037] The invention also includes polynucleotides with sequences complementary to those of the polynucleotides 
disclosed herein. 
[0038] The present invention also includes polynucleotides that hybridize under highly stringent conditions to polynu-
cleotides described herein. Also described herein are polynucleotides that hybridize under reduced stringency or stringent 
conditions to polynucleotides described herein. Examples of stringency conditions are shown in the table below: highly 
stringent conditions are those that are at least as stringent as, for example, conditions A-F; stringent conditions are at 
least as stringent as, for example, conditions G-L; and reduced stringency conditions are at least as stringent as, for 
example, conditions M-R.

 ‡ : The hybrid length is that anticipated for the hybridized region (s) of the hybridizing polynucleotides. When hybridizing 
a polynucleotide to a target polynucleotide of unknown sequence, the hybrid length is assumed to be that of the 
hybridizing polynucleotide. When polynucleotides of known sequence are hybridized, the hybrid length can be 
determined by aligning the sequences of the polynucleotides and identifying the region or regions of optimal sequence 
complementarity. 
 † : SSPE (1xSSPE is 0.15M NaCl, 10mM NaH 2 PO 4 , and 1.25mM EDTA, pH 7.4) can be substituted for SSC (1xSSC 
is 0.15M NaCl and 15mM sodium citrate) in the hybridization and wash buffers; washes are performed for 15 minutes 
after hybridization is complete. 
*T B -T R : The hybridization temperature for hybrids anticipated to be less than 50 base pairs in length should be 
5-10°C less than the melting temperature (T m ) of the hybrid, where T m is determined according to the following 
equations. For hybrids less than 18 base pairs in length, T m (°C) = 2 (# of A + T bases) + 4 (# of G + C bases). For 
hybrids between 18 and 49 base pairs in length. T m (°C) = 81.5 + 16.6 (log to [Na + ]) + 0.41 (%G+C)-(600/N), where N 
is the number of bases in the hybrid, and [Na + ] is the concentration of sodium ions in the hybridization buffer ([Na + ] 
for 1xSSC = 0.165 M).

has at least 60% sequence identity (more preferably, at least 75% identity; most preferably at least 90% or 95% identity) 
with the polynucleotide of the present invention to which it hybridizes, where sequence identity is determined by comparing 
the sequences of the hybridizing polynucleotides when aligned so as to maximize overlap and identity while minimizing 
sequence gaps. 
[0041] The isolated polynucleotide of the invention may be operably linked to an expression control sequence such 
as the pMT2 or pED expression vectors disclosed in Kaufman et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 19, 4485-4490 (1991), in order 
to produce the protein recombinantly. Many suitable expression control sequences are known in the art. General methods 
of expressing recombinant proteins are also known and are exemplified in R. Kaufman, Methods in Enzymology 185, 
537-566 (1990). As defined herein "operably linked" means that the isolated polynucleotide of the invention and an 
expression control sequence are situated within a vector or cell in such a way that the protein is expressed by a host 
cell which has been transformed (transfected) with the ligated polynucleotide/ expression control sequence. 
[0042] A number of types of cells may act as suitable host cells for expression of the protein. Mammalian host cells 
include, for example, monkey COS cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, human kidney 293 cells, human epidermal 
A431 cells, human Colo205 cells, 3T3 cells, CV-1 cells, other transformed primate cell lines, normal diploid cells, cell 
strains derived from in vitro culture of primary tissue, primary explants, HeLa cells, mouse L cells, BHK, HL-60, U937, 
HaK or Jurkat cells. 
[0043] Alternatively, it may be possible to produce the protein in lower eukaryotes such as yeast or in prokaryotes 
such as bacteria. Potentially suitable yeast strains include Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, 
Kluyveromyces strains, Candida, or any yeast strain capable of expressing heterologous proteins. Potentially suitable 
bacterial strains include Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhimurium, or any bacterial strain capable of 
expressing heterologous proteins. If the protein is made in yeast or bacteria, it may be necessary to modify the protein 
produced therein, for example by phosphorylation or glycosylation of the appropriate sites, in order to obtain the functional 
protein. Such covalent attachments may be accomplished using known chemical or enzymatic methods. 
[0044] The protein may also be produced by operably linking the isolated polynucleotide of the invention to suitable 
control sequences in one or more insect expression vectors, and employing an insect expression system. Materials and 
methods for baculovirus/ insect cell expression systems are commercially available in kit form from, e.g., Invitrogen, San 
Diego, California, U.S.A. (the MaxBac® kit), and such methods are well known in the art, as described in Summers and 
Smith, Texas Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin No. 1555 (1987). As used herein, an insect cell capable of ex-
pressing a polynucleotide of the present invention is "transformed." 
[0045] The protein of the invention may be prepared by culturing transformed host cells under culture conditions 
suitable to express the recombinant protein. The resulting expressed protein may then be purified from such culture 
(i.e., from culture medium or cell extracts) using known purification processes, such as gel filtration and ion exchange 
chromatography. The purification of the protein may also include an affinity column containing agents which will bind to 
the protein; one or more column steps over such affinity resins as concanavalin A-agarose, heparin-toyopearl® or 
Cibacrom blue 3GA Sepharose®; one or more steps involving hydrophobic interaction chromatography using such resins 
as phenyl ether, butyl ether, or propyl ether; or immunoaffinity chromatography. 
[0046] Alternatively, the protein of the invention may also be expressed in a form which will facilitate purification. For 
example, it may be expressed as a fusion protein, such as those of maltose binding protein (MBP), glutathione-S-
transferase (GST) or thioredoxin (TRX). Kits for expression and purification of such fusion proteins are commercially 
available from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Pharmacia (Piscataway. NJ) and Invitrogen Corporation (Carlsbad, 
CA), respectively. The protein can also be tagged with an epitope and subsequently purified by using a specific antibody 
directed to such epitope. One such epitope ("Flag") is commercially available from the Eastman Kodak Company (New 
Haven. CT). 
[0047] In addition, one or more reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) steps employing 
hydrophobic RP-HPLC media, e.g., silica gel having pendant methyl or other aliphatic groups, can be employed to further 
purify the protein. Some or all of the foregoing purification steps, in various combinations, can also be employed to 
provide a substantially homogeneous isolated recombinant protein. The protein thus purified is substantially free of other 
mammalian proteins and is defined in accordance with the present invention as an "isolated protein." 
[0048] The protein of the invention may also be expressed as a product of non-human transgenic animals, e.g., as a 
component of the milk of transgenic cows, goats, pigs, or sheep which are characterized by somatic or germ cells 
containing a nucleotide sequence encoding the protein. 
[0049] The protein may also be produced by known conventional chemical synthesis. Methods for constructing the 
proteins of the present invention by synthetic means are known to those skilled in the art. The synthetically-constructed 
protein sequences, by virtue of sharing primary, secondary or tertiary structural and/or conformational characteristics 
with proteins may possess biological properties in common therewith, including protein activity. Thus, they may be 
employed as biologically active or immunological substitutes for natural, purified proteins in screening of therapeutic 
compounds and in immunological processes for the development of antibodies. 
[0050] The proteins provided herein also include proteins characterized by amino acid sequences similar to those of 


EP 1 177 312 B1 

11 

5 





















purified proteins but into which modification are naturally provided or deliberately engineered. For example, modifications 
in the peptide or DNA sequences can be made by those skilled in the art using known techniques. Modifications of 
interest in the protein sequences may include the alteration, substitution, replacement, insertion or deletion of a selected 
amino acid residue in the coding sequence. For example, one or more of the cysteine residues may be deleted or 
replaced with another amino acid to alter the conformation of the molecule. Techniques for such alteration, substitution, 
replacement, insertion or deletion are well known to those skilled in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,518,584). 
Preferably, such alteration, substitution, replacement, insertion or deletion retains the desired activity of the protein. 
[0051] Other fragments and derivatives of the sequences of proteins which would be expected to retain protein activity 
in whole or in part and may thus be useful for screening or other immunological methodologies may also be easily made 
by those skilled in the art given the disclosures herein. Such modifications are believed to be encompassed by the 
present invention. 

USES AND BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY 

[0052] The polynucleotides and proteins of the present invention can exhibit one or more of the uses or biological 
activities (including those associated with assays cited herein) identified below. Uses or activities described for proteins 
of the present invention may be provided by administration or use of such proteins or by administration or use of 
polynucleotides encoding such proteins (such as, for example, in gene therapies or vectors suitable for introduction of 
DNA). 

hGIL-19 Uses 

[0053] Because of its homology to IL-10, human GIL-19/AE289 can be considered a member of the general family of 
cytokines and, as such, can exhibit similar activities to IL-10. Cytokines play important roles both in health and disease 
and have multiple clinical indications. Therefore this molecule (and other molecules of the present invention) will be 
useful as an agonist in certain clinical indications and antagonists of this molecule will be useful in other clinical situations, 
particularly in those in which IL-10 acts as an agonist or IL-10 antagonists act as an antagonist. Whether the agonist or 
antagonist is the preferred drug will depend on the particular aspects of the disease pathology, such as the cell types 
involved, the nature of the stimulus and the cellular microenvironment. 
[0054] In a preferred embodiment, a hGIL-19 activity is at least one or more of the following activities: (1) modulating, 
for example antagonizing a signal transduction pathway (e.g. a GIL-19 dependant pathway); (2) modulating cytokine 
production and/or secretion (e.g. production and/or secretion of a proinflammatory cytokine); (3) modulating lymphokine 
production and/or secretion; (4) modulating production of adhesion molecules and/or cellular adhesion; (5) modulating 
expression or activity of nuclear transcription factors; (7) modulating secretion of IL-1; (8) competing with receptors for 
other cytokines; (9) competing with another hGIL-19 family member protein to bind a hGIL-19 receptor; (10) modulating 
nuclear translocation of internalized receptor for hGIL-19 or another cytokine or ligand-complexed receptor, (11) mod-
ulating cell proliferation, development or differentiation, for example, cytokine-stimulated or a hGIL-19 protein-stimulated 
proliferation, development or differentiation (e.g., of an epithelial cell, for example, a squamous epithelial cell of the 
esophagus, or of a skin cell, e.g., a keratinocyte); (12) modulating cell proliferation, development or differentiation of an 
osteogenic cell (e.g., of an osteoclast precursor cell, osteoclast and/or osteoblast); (13) modulating bone formation, 
bone metabolism and/or bone homeostasis (e.g., inhibiting bone resorption); (15) modulating cellular immune responses; 
(16) modulating cytokine-mediated proinflammatory actions (e.g., inhibiting acute phase protein synthesis by hepato-
cytes, fever, and/or prostaglandin synthesis, for example PGE 2 synthesis); and (17) promoting and/or potentiating wound 
healing. 
[0055] Considering its apparent immunomodulatory role, human GIL-19/AE289 proteins may act on the following cell 
types: T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, macrophages/ monocytes, neutrophils, mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, antigen 
presenting cells of the nervous system and antigen presenting cells of the kidney. Based on its homology to IL-10, human 
GIL-19/AE289 proteins (or agonists or antagonistss thereof) can have the following activities and uses: 

(a) Upregulation of humoral immune responses and attenuates cell mediated immune reactions; 

(b) Function as an anti-inflammatory agent by inhibiting the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines; 

(c) Modulation of inflammatory responses associated with injury, sepsis, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular disease, 
and inflammation following surgery; 

(d) Treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, bone marrow transplantation to treat 
recipient before engraftment, bone marrow transplantation to treat stem cells of donor before transplantation, and 


EP 1 177 312 B1

to ameliorate graft versus host disease following bone marrow transplantation; 

(e) Treatment cell mediated autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, 
myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus, nephrotoxicity associated with glomerulonephritis, inflammatory 
bowel disease, Crohn's disease, pancreatitis, and asthma. 

[0056] Human GIL-19/AE289 agonists include without limitation human GIL-19/AE289 proteins and fragments, deletion 
mutants and addition mutants thereof; and peptide and small molecule compounds that interact with the receptor or 
other target to which human GIL-19/AE289 is directed. Human GIL-19/AE289 antagonists include without limitation 
antibodies directed to human GIL-19/AE289 proteins; soluble forms of the receptor or other target to which human GIL-
19/AE289 is directed; antibodies directed to the receptor or other target to which human GIL-19/AE289 is directed; and 
peptide and small molecule compounds that inhibit or interfere with the interaction of human GIL-19/AE289 with its 
receptor or other target. 

Research Uses and Utilities 

[0057] The polynucleotides provided by the present invention can be used by the research community for various 
purposes. The polynucleotides can be used to express recombinant protein for analysis, characterization or therapeutic 
use; as markers for tissues in which the corresponding protein is preferentially expressed (either constitutively or at a 
particular stage of tissue differentiation or development or in disease states); as molecular weight markers on Southern 
gels; as chromosome markers or tags (when labeled) to identify chromosomes or to map related gene positions; to 
compare with endogenous DNA sequences in patients to identify potential genetic disorders; as probes to hybridize and 
thus discover novel, related DNA sequences; as a source of information to derive PCR primers for genetic fingerprinting; 
as a probe to "subtract-out" known sequences in the process of discovering other novel polynucleotides; for selecting 
and making oligomers for attachment to a "gene chip" or other support, including for examination of expression patterns; 
to raise anti-protein antibodies using DNA immunization techniques; and as an antigen to raise anti-DNA antibodies or 
elicit another immune response. Where the polynucleotide encodes a protein which binds or potentially binds to another 
protein (such as, for example, in a receptor-ligand interaction), the polynucleotide can also be used in interaction trap 
assays (such as, for example, those described in Gyuris et al., 1993, Cell 75: 791-803 and in Rossi et al., 1997, Proc. 
Natl. Acad Sci. USA 94: 8405-8410) to identify polynucleotides encoding the other protein with which binding occurs or 
to identify inhibitors of the binding interaction. 
[0058] The proteins provided by the present invention can similarly be used in assays to determine biological activity, 
including in a panel of multiple proteins for high-throughput screening; to raise antibodies or to elicit another immune 
response; as a reagent (including the labeled reagent) in assays designed to quantitatively determine levels of the protein 
(or its receptor) in biological fluids ; as markers for tissues in which the corresponding protein is preferentially expressed 
(either constitutively or at a particular stage of tissue differentiation or development or in a disease state); and, of course, 
to isolate correlative receptors or ligands. Where the protein binds or potentially binds to another protein (such as, for 
example, in a receptor-ligand interaction), the protein can be used to identify the other protein with which binding occurs 
or to identify inhibitors of the binding interaction. Proteins involved in these binding interactions can also be used to 
screen for peptide or small molecule inhibitors or agonists of the binding interaction. 
[0059] Any or all of these research utilities are capable of being developed into reagent grade or kit format for com-
mercialization as research products. 
[0060] Methods for performing the uses listed above are well known to those skilled in the art. References disclosing 
such methods include without limitation "Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual", 2d ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory 
Press, Sambrook, J., E.F. Fritsch and T. Maniatis eds., 1989, and "Methods in Enzymology: Guide to Molecular Cloning 
Techniques", Academic Press, Berger, S.L. and A.R. Kimmel eds., 1987. 

Nutritional Uses 

[0061] Polynucleotides and proteins of the present invention can also be used as nutritional sources or supplements. 
Such uses include without limitation use as a protein or amino acid supplement, use as a carbon source, use as a 
nitrogen source and use as a source of carbohydrate. In such cases the protein or polynucleotide of the invention can 
be added to the feed of a particular organism or can be administered as a separate solid or liquid preparation, such as 
in the form of powder, pills, solutions, suspensions or capsules. In the case of microorganisms, the protein or polynu-
cleotide of the invention can be added to the medium in or on which the microorganism is cultured.

Cytokine and Cell Proliferation/ Differentiation Activity 

[0062] A protein of the present invention may exhibit cytokine, cell proliferation (either inducing or inhibiting) or cell 
differentiation (either inducing or inhibiting) activity or may induce production of other cytokines in certain cell populations. 
Many protein factors discovered to date, including all known cytokines, have exhibited activity in one or more factor-
dependent cell proliferation assays, and hence the assays serve as a convenient confirmation of cytokine activity. The 
activity of a protein of the present invention is evidenced by any one of a number of routine factor dependent cell 
proliferation assays for cell lines including, without limitation, 32D, DA2, DA1G, T10, B9, B9/11, BaF3, MC9/G, M+ (preB 
M+), 2E8, RB5, DA1, 123, T1165, HT2, CTLL2, TF-1, Mo7e and CMK. The activity of a protein of the invention may, 
among other means, be measured by the following methods:

Immune Stimulating or Suppressing Activity 

[0063] A protein of the present invention may also exhibit immune stimulating or immune suppressing activity, including 
without limitation the activities for which assays are described herein. A protein may be useful in the treatment of various 
immune deficiencies and disorders (including severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)), e.g., in regulating (up or 
down) growth and proliferation of T and/or B lymphocytes, as well as affecting the cytolytic activity of NK cells and other 
cell populations. These immune deficiencies may be genetic or be caused by viral (e.g., HIV) as well as bacterial or 
fungal infections, or may result from autoimmune disorders. More specifically, infectious diseases caused by viral, 
bacterial, fungal or other infection may be treatable using a protein of the present invention, including infections by HIV, 
hepatitis viruses, herpesviruses, mycobacteria, Leishmania spp., malaria spp. and various fungal infections such as 
candidiasis. Of course, in this regard, a protein of the present invention may also be useful where a boost to the immune 
system generally may be desirable, i.e., in the treatment of cancer. 
[0064] Autoimmune disorders which may be treated using a protein of the present invention include, for example, 
connective tissue disease, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune pulmo-
nary inflammation, Guillain-Barre syndrome, autoimmune thyroiditis, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, myasthenia 
gravis, graft-versus-host disease and autoimmune inflammatory eye disease. Such a protein of the present invention 
may also to be useful in the treatment of allergic reactions and conditions, such as asthma (particularly allergic asthma)

or other respiratory problems. Other conditions, in which immune suppression is desired (including, for example, organ 
transplantation), may also be treatable using a protein of the present invention. 
[0065] Using the proteins of the invention it may also be possible to regulate immune responses in a number of ways. 
Down regulation may be in the form of inhibiting or blocking an immune response already in progress or may involve 
preventing the induction of an immune response. The functions of activated T cells may be inhibited by suppressing T 
cell responses or by inducing specific tolerance in T cells, or both. Immunosuppression of T cell responses is generally 
an active, non-antigen-specific, process which requires continuous exposure of the T cells to the suppressive agent. 
Tolerance, which involves inducing non-responsiveness or anergy in T cells, is distinguishable from immunosuppression 
in that it is generally antigen-specific and persists after exposure to the tolerizing agent has ceased. Operationally, 
tolerance can be demonstrated by the lack of a T cell response upon reexposure to specific antigen in the absence of 
the tolerizing agent. 
[0066] Down regulating or preventing one or more antigen functions (including without limitation B lymphocyte antigen 
functions (such as, for example, B7)), e.g., preventing high level lymphokine synthesis by activated T cells, will be useful 
in situations of tissue, skin and organ transplantation and in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). For example, blockage 
of T cell function should result in reduced tissue destruction in tissue transplantation. Typically, in tissue transplants, 
rejection of the transplant is initiated through its recognition as foreign by T cells, followed by an immune reaction that 
destroys the transplant. The administration of a molecule which inhibits or blocks interaction of a B7 lymphocyte antigen 
with its natural ligand (s) on immune cells (such as a soluble, monomeric form of a peptide having B7-2 activity alone or 
in conjunction with a monomeric form of a peptide having an activity of another B lymphocyte antigen (e.g., B7-1, B7-3) 
or blocking antibody, prior to transplantation can lead to the binding of the molecule to the natural ligand (s) on the immune 
cells without transmitting the corresponding costimulatory signal. Blocking B lymphocyte antigen function in this matter 
prevents cytokine synthesis by immune cells, such as T cells, and thus acts as an immunosuppressant. Moreover, the 
lack of costimulation may also be sufficient to anergize the T cells, thereby inducing tolerance in a subject. Induction of 
long-term tolerance by B lymphocyte antigen-blocking reagents may avoid the necessity of repeated administration of 
these blocking reagents. To achieve sufficient immunosuppression or tolerance in a subject, it may also be necessary 
to block the function of a combination of B lymphocyte antigens. 
[0067] The efficacy of particular blocking reagents in preventing organ transplant rejection or GVHD can be assessed 
using animal models that are predictive of efficacy in humans. Examples of appropriate systems which can be used 
include allogeneic cardiac grafts in rats and xenogeneic pancreatic islet cell grafts in mice, both of which have been 
used to examine the immunosuppressive effects of CTLA4Ig fusion proteins in vivo as described in Lenschow et al., 
Science 257: 789-792 (1992) and Turka et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 89: 11102-11105 (1992) . In addition, murine 
models of GVHD (see Paul ed., Fundamental Immunology, Raven Press, New York, 1989, pp. 846-847) can be used 
to determine the effect of blocking B lymphocyte antigen function in vivo on the development of that disease. 
[0068] Blocking antigen function may also be therapeutically useful for treating autoimmune diseases. Many autoim-
mune disorders are the result of inappropriate activation of T cells that are reactive against self tissue and which promote 
the production of cytokines and autoantibodies involved in the pathology of the diseases. Preventing the activation of 
autoreactive T cells may reduce or eliminate disease symptoms. Administration of reagents which block costimulation 
of T cells by disrupting receptor: ligand interactions of B lymphocyte antigens can be used to inhibit T cell activation and 
prevent production of autoantibodies or T cell-derived cytokines which may be involved in the disease process. Addi-
tionally, blocking reagents may induce antigen-specific tolerance of autoreactive T cells which could lead to long-term 
relief from the disease. The efficacy of blocking reagents in preventing or alleviating autoimmune disorders can be 
determined using a number of well-characterized animal models of human autoimmune diseases. Examples include 
murine experimental autoimmune encephalitis, systemic lupus erythmatosis in MRL/ lpr/ lpr mice or NZB hybrid mice, 
murine autoimmune collagen arthritis, diabetes mellitus in NOD mice and BB rats, and murine experimental myasthenia 
gravis (see Paul ed., Fundamental Immunology, Raven Press, New York, 1989, pp. 840-856). 
[0069] Upregulation of an antigen function (preferably a B lymphocyte antigen function), as a means of up regulating 
immune responses, may also be useful in therapy. Upregulation of immune responses may be in the form of enhancing 
an existing immune response or eliciting an initial immune response. For example, enhancing an immune response 
through stimulating B lymphocyte antigen function may be useful in cases of viral infection. In addition, systemic viral 
diseases such as influenza, the common cold, and encephalitis might be alleviated by the administration of stimulatory 
forms of B lymphocyte antigens systemically. 
[0070] Alternatively, anti-viral immune responses may be enhanced in an infected patient by removing T cells from 
the patient, costimulating the T cells in vitro with viral antigen-pulsed APCs either expressing a peptide of the present 
invention or together with a stimulatory form of a soluble peptide of the present invention and reintroducing the in vitro 
activated T cells into the patient. Another method of enhancing anti-viral immune responses would be to isolate infected 
cells from a patient, transfect them with a nucleic acid encoding a protein of the present invention as described herein 
such that the cells express all or a portion of the protein on their surface, and reintroduce the transfected cells into the 
patient. The infected cells would now be capable of delivering a costimulatory signal to, and thereby activate, T cells in vivo.

[0071] In another application, up regulation or enhancement of antigen function (preferably B lymphocyte antigen 
function) may be useful in the induction of tumor immunity. Tumor cells (e.g., sarcoma, melanoma, lymphoma, leukemia, 
neuroblastoma, carcinoma) transfected with a nucleic acid encoding at least one peptide of the present invention can 
be administered to a subject to overcome tumor-specific tolerance in the subject. If desired, the tumor cell can be 
transfected to express a combination of peptides. For example, tumor cells obtained from a patient can be transfected 
ex vivo with an expression vector directing the expression of a peptide having B7-2-like activity alone, or in conjunction 
with a peptide having B7-1-like activity and/or B7-3-like activity. The transfected tumor cells are returned to the patient 
to result in expression of the peptides on the surface of the transfected cell. Alternatively, gene therapy techniques can 
be used to target a tumor cell for transfection in vivo. 
[0072] The presence of the peptide of the present invention having the activity of a B lymphocyte antigen (s) on the 
surface of the tumor cell provides the necessary costimulation signal to T cells to induce a T cell mediated immune 
response against the transfected tumor cells. In addition, tumor cells which lack MHC class I or MHC class II molecules, 
or which fail to reexpress sufficient amounts of MHC class I or MHC class II molecules, can be transfected with nucleic 
acid encoding all or a portion of (e.g., a cytoplasmic-domain truncated portion) of an MHC class I a chain protein and 
β 2 microglobulin protein or an MHC class II a chain protein and an MHC class II β chain protein to thereby express MHC 

class I or MHC class II proteins on the cell surface. Expression of the appropriate class I or class II MHC in conjunction 
with a peptide having the activity of a B lymphocyte antigen (e.g., B7-1, B7-2, B7-3) induces a T cell mediated immune 
response against the transfected tumor cell. Optionally, a gene encoding an antisense construct which blocks expression 
of an MHC class II associated protein, such as the invariant chain, can also be cotransfected with a DNA encoding a 
peptide having the activity of a B lymphocyte antigen to promote presentation of tumor associated antigens and induce 
tumor specific immunity. Thus, the induction of a T cell mediated immune response in a human subject may be sufficient 
to overcome tumor-specific tolerance in the subject. 
[0073] The activity of a protein of the invention may, among other means, be measured by the following methods:

Hematopoiesis Regulating Activity 

[0074] A protein of the present invention may be useful in regulation of hematopoiesis and, consequently, in the 
treatment of myeloid or lymphoid cell deficiencies. Even marginal biological activity in support of colony forming cells or 
of factor-dependent cell lines indicates involvement in regulating hematopoiesis, e.g. in supporting the growth and 
proliferation of erythroid progenitor cells alone or in combination with other cytokines, thereby indicating utility, for example, 
in treating various anemias or for use in conjunction with irradiation/ chemotherapy to stimulate the production of erythroid 
precursors and/or erythroid cells; in supporting the growth and proliferation of myeloid cells such as granulocytes and 
monocytes/ macrophages (i.e., traditional CSF activity) useful, for example, in conjunction with chemotherapy to prevent 
or treat consequent myelo-suppression; in supporting the growth and proliferation of megakaryocytes and consequently 
of platelets thereby allowing prevention or treatment of various platelet disorders such as thrombocytopenia, and generally 
for use in place of or complimentary to platelet transfusions; and/or in supporting the growth and proliferation of hemat-
opoietic stem cells which are capable of maturing to any and all of the above-mentioned hematopoietic cells and therefore 
find therapeutic utility in various stem cell disorders (such as those usually treated with transplantation, including, without 
limitation, aplastic anemia and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria), as well as in repopulating the stem cell compart-
ment post irradiation/ chemotherapy, either in-vivo or ex-vivo (i.e., in conjunction with bone marrow transplantation or 
with peripheral progenitor cell transplantation (homologous or heterologous)) as normal cells or genetically manipulated 
for gene therapy. 
[0075] The activity of a protein of the invention may, among other means, be measured by the following methods: 

Suitable assays for proliferation and differentiation of various hematopoietic lines are cited above. 

[0076] Assays for embryonic stem cell differentiation (which will identify, among others, proteins that influence em-
bryonic differentiation hematopoiesis) include, without limitation, those described in: Johansson et al. Cellular Biology

Tissue Growth Activity 

[0078] A protein of the present invention also may have utility in compositions used for bone, cartilage, tendon, ligament 
and/or nerve tissue growth or regeneration, as well as for wound healing and tissue repair and replacement, and in the 
treatment of burns, incisions and ulcers. 
[0079] A protein of the present invention, which induces cartilage and/or bone growth in circumstances where bone 
is not normally formed, has application in the healing of bone fractures and cartilage damage or defects in humans and 
other animals. Such a preparation employing a protein of the invention may have prophylactic use in closed as well as 
open fracture reduction and also in the improved fixation of artificial joints. De novo bone formation induced by an 
osteogenic agent contributes to the repair of congenital, trauma induced, or oncologic resection induced craniofacial 
defects, and also is useful in cosmetic plastic surgery. 
[0080] A protein of this invention may also be used in the treatment of periodontal disease, and in other tooth repair 
processes. Such agents may provide an environment to attract bone-forming cells, stimulate growth of bone-forming 
cells or induce differentiation of progenitors of bone-forming cells. A protein of the invention may also be useful in the 
treatment of osteoporosis or osteoarthritis, such as through stimulation of bone and/or cartilage repair or by blocking 
inflammation or processes of tissue destruction (collagenase activity, osteoclast activity, etc.) mediated by inflammatory 


EP 1 177 312 B1

processes. 
[0081] Another category of tissue regeneration activity that may be attributable to the protein of the present invention 
is tendon/ ligament formation. A protein of the present invention, which induces tendon/ ligament-like tissue or other tissue 
formation in circumstances where such tissue is not normally formed, has application in the healing of tendon or ligament 
tears, deformities and other tendon or ligament defects in humans and other animals. Such a preparation employing a 
tendon/ ligament-like tissue inducing protein may have prophylactic use in preventing damage to tendon or ligament 
tissue, as well as use in the improved fixation of tendon or ligament to bone or other tissues, and in repairing defects to 
tendon or ligament tissue. De novo tendon/ ligament-like tissue formation induced by a composition of the present 
invention contributes to the repair of congenital, trauma induced, or other tendon or ligament defects of other origin, and 
is also useful in cosmetic plastic surgery for attachment or repair of tendons or ligaments. The compositions of the 
present invention may provide an environment to attract tendon-or ligament-forming cells, stimulate growth of tendon-
or ligament-forming cells, induce differentiation of progenitors of tendon-or ligament-forming cells, or induce growth of 
tendon/ ligament cells or progenitors ex vivo for return in vivo to effect tissue repair. The compositions of the invention 
may also be useful in the treatment of tendinitis, carpal tunnel syndrome and other tendon or ligament defects. The 
compositions may also include an appropriate matrix and/or sequestering agent as a carrier as is well known in the art. 
[0082] The protein of the present invention may also be useful for proliferation of neural cells and for regeneration of 
nerve and brain tissue, i.e. for the treatment of central and peripheral nervous system diseases and neuropathies, as 
well as mechanical and traumatic disorders, which involve degeneration, death or trauma to neural cells or nerve tissue. 
More specifically, a protein may be used in the treatment of diseases of the peripheral nervous system, such as peripheral 
nerve injuries, peripheral neuropathy and localized neuropathies, and central nervous system diseases, such as Alzhe-
imer's, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Shy-Drager syndrome. Further 
conditions which may be treated in accordance with the present invention include mechanical and traumatic disorders, 
such as spinal cord disorders, head trauma and cerebrovascular diseases such as stroke. Peripheral neuropathies 
resulting from chemotherapy or other medical therapies may also be treatable using a protein of the invention. 
[0083] Proteins of the invention may also be useful to promote better or faster closure of non-healing wounds, including 
without limitation pressure ulcers, ulcers associated with vascular insufficiency, surgical and traumatic wounds, and the 
like. 
[0084] It is expected that a protein of the present invention may also exhibit activity for generation or regeneration of 
other tissues, such as organs (including, for example, pancreas, liver, intestine, kidney, skin, endothelium), muscle 
(smooth, skeletal or cardiac) and vascular (including vascular endothelium) tissue, or for promoting the growth of cells 
comprising such tissues. Part of the desired effects may be by inhibition or modulation of fibrotic scarring to allow normal 
tissue to regenerate. A protein of the invention may also exhibit angiogenic activity. 
[0085] A protein of the present invention may also be useful for gut protection or regeneration and treatment of lung 
or liver fibrosis, reperfusion injury in various tissues, and conditions resulting from systemic cytokine damage. 
[0086] A protein of the present invention may also be useful for promoting or inhibiting differentiation of tissues described 
above from precursor tissues or cells; or for inhibiting the growth of tissues described above. 
[0087] The activity of a protein of the invention may, among other means, be measured by the following methods: 

Assays for tissue generation activity include, without limitation, those described in: International Patent Publication 
No. WO95/16035 (bone, cartilage, tendon); International Patent Publication No. WO95/05846 (nerve, neuronal); 
International Patent Publication No. WO91/07491 (skin, endothelium). 
Assays for wound healing activity include, without limitation, those described in: Winter, Epidermal Wound Healing, 
pps. 71-112 (Maibach, HI and Rovee, DT, eds.), Year Book Medical Publishers, Inc., Chicago, as modified by 
Eaglstein and Mertz, J. Invest. Dermatol 71: 382-84 (1978) . 

Activin/ Inhibin Activity 

[0088] A protein of the present invention may also exhibit activin-or inhibin-related activities. Inhibins are characterized 
by their ability to inhibit the release of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), while activins and are characterized by their 
ability to stimulate the release of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Thus, a protein of the present invention, alone or 
in heterodimers with a member of the inhibin a family, may be useful as a contraceptive based on the ability of inhibins 
to decrease fertility in female mammals and decrease spermatogenesis in male mammals. Administration of sufficient 
amounts of other inhibins can induce infertility in these mammals. Alternatively, the protein of the invention, as a ho-
modimer or as a heterodimer with other protein subunits of the inhibin-β group, may be useful as a fertility inducing 
therapeutic, based upon the ability of activin molecules in stimulating FSH release from cells of the anterior pituitary. 
See, for example, United States Patent 4,798,885. A protein of the invention may also be useful for advancement of the 
onset of fertility in sexually immature mammals, so as to increase the lifetime reproductive performance of domestic 
animals such as cows, sheep and pigs.

Assays for activin/ inhibin activity include, without limitation, those described in: Vale et al., Endocrinology 91: 562-572, 
1972; Ling et al., Nature 321: 779-782, 1986; Vale et al., Nature 321: 776-779, 1986; Mason et al., Nature 318: 
659-663, 1985; Forage et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83: 3091-3095, 1986. 

Chemotactic/ Chemokinetic Activity 

[0090] A protein of the present invention may have chemotactic or chemokinetic activity (e.g., act as a chemokine) 
for mammalian cells, including, for example, monocytes, fibroblasts, neutrophils, T-cells, mast cells, eosinophils, epithelial 
and/or endothelial cells. Chemotactic and chemokinetic proteins can be used to mobilize or attract a desired cell population 
to a desired site of action. Chemotactic or chemokinetic proteins provide particular advantages in treatment of wounds 
and other trauma to tissues, as well as in treatment of localized infections. For example, attraction of lymphocytes, 
monocytes or neutrophils to tumors or sites of infection may result in improved immune responses against the tumor or 
infecting agent. 
[0091] A protein or peptide has chemotactic activity for a particular cell population if it can stimulate, directly or indirectly, 
the directed orientation or movement of such cell population. Preferably, the protein or peptide has the ability to directly 
stimulate directed movement of cells. Whether a particular protein has chemotactic activity for a population of cells can 
be readily determined by employing such protein or peptide in any known assay for cell chemotaxis. 
[0092] The activity of a protein of the invention may, among other means, be measured by the following methods: 

Assays for chemotactic activity (which will identify proteins that induce or prevent chemotaxis) consist of assays 
that measure the ability of a protein to induce the migration of cells across a membrane as well as the ability of a 
protein to induce the adhesion of one cell population to another cell population. Suitable assays for movement and 
adhesion include, without limitation, those described in: Current Protocols in Immunology, Ed by J.E. Coligan, A.M.

Hemostatic and Thrombolytic Activity 

[0093] A protein of the invention may also exhibit hemostatic or thrombolytic activity. As a result, such a protein is 
expected to be useful in treatment of various coagulation disorders (including hereditary disorders, such as hemophilias) 
or to enhance coagulation and other hemostatic events in treating wounds resulting from trauma, surgery or other causes. 
A protein of the invention may also be useful for dissolving or inhibiting formation of thromboses and for treatment and 
prevention of conditions resulting therefrom (such as, for example, infarction of cardiac and central nervous system 
vessels (e.g., stroke).

71-79 (1991) ; Schaub, Prostaglandins 35: 467-474, 1988. 

Receptor/ Ligand Activity 

[0095] A protein of the present invention may also demonstrate activity as receptors, receptor ligands or inhibitors or 
agonists of receptor/ ligand interactions. Examples of such receptors and ligands include, without limitation, cytokine 
receptors and their ligands, receptor kinases and their ligands, receptor phosphatases and their ligands, receptors 
involved in cell-cell interactions and their ligands (including without limitation, cellular adhesion molecules (such as 
selectins, integrins and their ligands) and receptor/ ligand pairs involved in antigen presentation, antigen recognition and 
development of cellular and humoral immune responses). Receptors and ligands are also useful for screening of potential 
peptide or small molecule inhibitors of the relevant receptor/ ligand interaction. A protein of the present invention (including, 
without limitation, fragments of receptors and ligands) may themselves be useful as inhibitors of receptor/ ligand inter-
actions. 
[0096] The activity of a protein of the invention may, among other means, be measured by the following methods: 

Suitable assays for receptor-ligand activity include without limitation those described in: Current Protocols in Immu-

Anti-Inflammatory Activity 

[0097] Proteins of the present invention may also exhibit anti-inflammatory activity. The anti-inflammatory activity may 
be achieved by providing a stimulus to cells involved in the inflammatory response, by inhibiting or promoting cell-cell 
interactions (such as, for example, cell adhesion), by inhibiting or promoting chemotaxis of cells involved in the inflam-
matory process, inhibiting or promoting cell extravasation, or by stimulating or suppressing production of other factors 
which more directly inhibit or promote an inflammatory response. Proteins exhibiting such activities can be used to treat 
inflammatory conditions including chronic or acute conditions), including without limitation inflammation associated with 
infection (such as septic shock, sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)), ischemia-reperfusion 
injury, endotoxin lethality, arthritis, complement-mediated hyperacute rejection, nephritis, cytokine or chemokine-induced 
lung injury, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease or resulting from over production of cytokines such as TNF or 
IL-1. Proteins of the invention may also be useful to treat anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity to an antigenic substance or 
material. 

Cadherin/ Tumor Invasion Suppressor Activity 

[0098] Cadherins are calcium-dependent adhesion molecules that appear to play major roles during development, 
particularly in defining specific cell types. Loss or alteration of normal cadherin expression can lead to changes in cell 
adhesion properties linked to tumor growth and metastasis. Cadherin malfunction is also implicated in other human 
diseases, such as pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus (auto-immune blistering skin diseases), Crohn's disease, 
and some developmental abnormalities. 
[0099] The cadherin superfamily includes well over forty members, each with a distinct pattern of expression. All 
members of the superfamily have in common conserved extracellular repeats (cadherin domains), but structural differ-
ences are found in other parts of the molecule. The cadherin domains bind calcium to form their tertiary structure and 
thus calcium is required to mediate their adhesion. Only a few amino acids in the first cadherin domain provide the basis 
for homophilic adhesion; modification of this recognition site can change the specificity of a cadherin so that instead of 
recognizing only itself, the mutant molecule can now also bind to a different cadherin. In addition, some cadherins engage 
in heterophilic adhesion with other cadherins. 
[0100] E-cadherin, one member of the cadherin superfamily, is expressed in epithelial cell types. Pathologically, if E-
cadherin expression is lost in a tumor, the malignant cells become invasive and the cancer metastasizes. Transfection 
of cancer cell lines with polynucleotides expressing E-cadherin has reversed cancer-associated changes by returning 
altered cell shapes to normal, restoring cells' adhesiveness to each other and to their substrate, decreasing the cell 
growth rate, and drastically reducing anchorage-independent cell growth. Thus, reintroducing E-cadherin expression 
reverts carcinomas to a less advanced stage. It is likely that other cadherins have the same invasion suppressor role in 
carcinomas derived from other tissue types. Therefore, proteins of the present invention with cadherin activity, and 
polynucleotides of the present invention encoding such proteins, can be used to treat cancer. Introducing such proteins 
or polynucleotides into cancer cells can reduce or eliminate the cancerous changes observed in these cells by providing 
normal cadherin expression. 
[0101] Cancer cells have also been shown to express cadherins of a different tissue type than their origin, thus allowing 
these cells to invade and metastasize in a different tissue in the body. Proteins of the present invention with cadherin 
activity, and polynucleotides of the present invention encoding such proteins, can be substituted in these cells for the 
inappropriately expressed cadherins, restoring normal cell adhesive properties and reducing or eliminating the tendency 
of the cells to metastasize. 
[0102] Additionally, proteins of the present invention with cadherin activity, and polynucleotides of the present invention 
encoding such proteins, can used to generate antibodies recognizing and binding to cadherins. Such antibodies can be 
used to block the adhesion of inappropriately expressed tumor-cell cadherins, preventing the cells from forming a tumor 
elsewhere. Such an anti-cadherin antibody can also be used as a marker for the grade, pathological type, and prognosis 
of a cancer, i.e. the more progressed the cancer, the less cadherin expression there will be, and this decrease in cadherin 
expression can be detected by the use of a cadherin-binding antibody. 
[0103] Fragments of proteins of the present invention with cadherin activity, preferably a polypeptide comprising a 
decapeptide of the cadherin recognition site, and polynucleotides of the present invention encoding such protein frag-
ments, can also be used to block cadherin function by binding to cadherins and preventing them from binding in ways

that produce undesirable effects. Additionally, fragments of proteins of the present invention with cadherin activity, 
preferably truncated soluble cadherin fragments which have been found to be stable in the circulation of cancer patients, 
and polynucleotides encoding such protein fragments, can be used to disturb proper cell-cell adhesion. 
[0104] Assays for cadherin adhesive and invasive suppressor activity include, without limitation, those described in: 
Hortsch et al. J Biol Chem 270 (32): 18809-18817, 1995; Miyaki et al. Oncogene 11: 2547-2552, 1995; Ozawa et al. 
Cell 63: 1033-1038,1990. 

Tumor Inhibition Activity 

[0105] In addition to the activities described above for immunological treatment or prevention of tumors, a protein of 
the invention may exhibit other anti-tumor activities. A protein may inhibit tumor growth directly or indirectly (such as, 
for example, via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)). A protein may exhibit its tumor inhibitory activity 
by acting on tumor tissue or tumor precursor tissue, by inhibiting formation of tissues necessary to support tumor growth 
(such as, for example, by inhibiting angiogenesis), by causing production of other factors, agents or cell types which 
inhibit tumor growth, or by suppressing, eliminating or inhibiting factors, agents or cell types which promote tumor growth. 

Other Activities 

[0106] A protein of the invention may also exhibit one or more of the following additional activities or effects: inhibiting 
the growth, infection or function of, or killing, infectious agents, including, without limitation, bacteria, viruses, fungi and 
other parasites; effecting (suppressing or enhancing) bodily characteristics, including, without limitation, height, weight, 
hair color, eye color, skin, fat to lean ratio or other tissue pigmentation, or organ or body part size or shape (such as, for 
example, breast augmentation or diminution, change in bone form or shape); effecting biorhythms or circadic cycles or 
rhythms; effecting the fertility of male or female subjects; effecting the metabolism, catabolism, anabolism, processing, 
utilization, storage or elimination of dietary fat, lipid, protein, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals, cofactors or other nutritional 
factors or component (s); effecting behavioral characteristics, including, without limitation, appetite, libido, stress, cognition 
(including cognitive disorders), depression (including depressive disorders) and violent behaviors; providing analgesic 
effects or other pain reducing effects; promoting differentiation and growth of embryonic stem cells in lineages other 
than hematopoietic lineages; hormonal or endocrine activity; in the case of enzymes, correcting deficiencies of the 
enzyme and treating deficiency-related diseases; treatment of hyperproliferative disorders (such as, for example, pso-
riasis); immunoglobulin-like activity (such as, for example, the ability to bind antigens or complement); and the ability to 
act as an antigen in a vaccine composition to raise an immune response against such protein or another material or 
entity which is cross-reactive with such protein. 

Administration and Dosing 

[0107] A protein of the present invention (from whatever source derived, including without limitation from recombinant 
and non-recombinant sources) may be used in a pharmaceutical composition when combined with a pharmaceutically 
acceptable carrier. Such a composition may also contain (in addition to protein and a carrier) diluents, fillers, salts, 
buffers, stabilizers, solubilizers, and other materials well known in the art. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" means 
a non-toxic material that does not interfere with the effectiveness of the biological activity of the active ingredient (s). The 
characteristics of the carrier will depend on the route of administration. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention 
may also contain cytokines, lymphokines, or other hematopoietic factors such as M-CSF, GM-CSF, TNF, IL-1, IL-2, IL-
3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12, IL-13, IL-14, IL-15, IFN, TNF0, TNF1, TNF2, G-CSF, Meg-CSF, 
thrombopoietin, stem cell factor, and erythropoietin. The pharmaceutical composition may further contain other agents 
which either enhance the activity of the protein or compliment its activity or use in treatment. Such additional factors 
and/or agents may be included in the pharmaceutical composition to produce a synergistic effect with protein of the 
invention, or to minimize side effects. Conversely, protein of the present invention may be included in formulations of 
the particular cytokine, lymphokine, other hematopoietic factor, thrombolytic or anti-thrombotic factor, or anti-inflammatory 
agent to minimize side effects of the cytokine, lymphokine, other hematopoietic factor, thrombolytic or anti-thrombotic 
factor, or anti-inflammatory agent. 
[0108] A protein of the present invention may be active in multimers (e.g., heterodimers or homodimers) or complexes 
with itself or other proteins. As a result, pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may comprise a protein of the 
invention in such multimeric or complexed form. 
[0109] The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be in the form of a complex of the protein (s) of present 
invention along with protein or peptide antigens. The protein and/or peptide antigen will deliver a stimulatory signal to 
both B and T lymphocytes. B lymphocytes will respond to antigen through their surface immunoglobulin receptor. T 
lymphocytes will respond to antigen through the T cell receptor (TCR) following presentation of the antigen by MHC 


EP 1 177 312 B1 

21 

5 





















proteins. MHC and structurally related proteins including those encoded by class I and class II MHC genes on host cells 
will serve to present the peptide antigen (s) to T lymphocytes. The antigen components could also be supplied as purified 
MHC-peptide complexes alone or with co-stimulatory molecules that can directly signal T cells. Alternatively antibodies 
able to bind surface immunolgobulin and other molecules on B cells as well as antibodies able to bind the TCR and 
other molecules on T cells can be combined with the pharmaceutical composition of the invention. 
[0110] The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be in the form of a liposome in which protein of the 
present invention is combined, in addition to other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, with amphipathic agents such 
as lipids which exist in aggregated form as micelles, insoluble monolayers, liquid crystals, or lamellar layers in aqueous 
solution. Suitable lipids for liposomal formulation include, without limitation, monoglycerides, diglycerides, sulfatides, 
lysolecithin, phospholipids, saponin, bile acids, and the like. Preparation of such liposomal formulations is within the 
level of skill in the art, as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,235,871; U.S. Patent No. 4,501,728; U.S. Patent 
No. 4,837,028; and U.S. Patent No. 4,737,323, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. 
[0111] As used herein, the term "therapeutically effective amount" means the total amount of each active component 
of the pharmaceutical composition or method that is sufficient to show a meaningful patient benefit, i.e., treatment, 
healing, prevention or amelioration of the relevant medical condition, or an increase in rate of treatment, healing, pre-
vention or amelioration of such conditions. When applied to an individual active ingredient, administered alone, the term 
refers to that ingredient alone. When applied to a combination, the term refers to combined amounts of the active 
ingredients that result in the therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially or simultaneously. 
[0112] In practicing the method of treatment or use of the present invention, a therapeutically effective amount of 
protein of the present invention is administered to a mammal having a condition to be treated. Protein of the present 
invention may be administered in accordance with the method of the invention either alone or in combination with other 
therapies such as treatments employing cytokines, lymphokines or other hematopoietic factors. When co-administered 
with one or more cytokines, lymphokines or other hematopoietic factors, protein of the present invention may be admin-
istered either simultaneously with the cytokine (s), lymphokine (s), other hematopoietic factor (s), thrombolytic or anti-
thrombotic factors, or sequentially. If administered sequentially, the attending physician will decide on the appropriate 
sequence of administering protein of the present invention in combination with cytokine (s), lymphokine (s), other hemat-
opoietic factor (s), thrombolytic or anti-thrombotic factors. 
[0113] Administration of protein of the present invention used in the pharmaceutical composition or to practice the 
method of the present invention can be carried out in a variety of conventional ways, such as oral ingestion, inhalation, 
topical application or cutaneous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, parenteral or intravenous injection. Intravenous admin-
istration to the patient is preferred. 
[0114] When a therapeutically effective amount of protein of the present invention is administered orally, protein of 
the present invention will be in the form of a tablet, capsule, powder, solution or elixir. When administered in tablet form, 
the pharmaceutical composition of the invention may additionally contain a solid carrier such as a gelatin or an adjuvant. 
The tablet, capsule, and powder contain from about 5 to 95% protein of the present invention, and preferably from about 
25 to 90% protein of the present invention. When administered in liquid form, a liquid carrier such as water, petroleum, 
oils of animal or plant origin such as peanut oil, mineral oil, soybean oil, or sesame oil, or synthetic oils may be added. 
The liquid form of the pharmaceutical composition may further contain physiological saline solution, dextrose or other 
saccharide solution, or glycols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol. When administered in 
liquid form, the pharmaceutical composition contains from about 0.5 to 90% by weight of protein of the present invention, 
and preferably from about 1 to 50% protein of the present invention. 
[0115] When a therapeutically effective amount of protein of the present invention is administered by intravenous, 
cutaneous or subcutaneous injection, protein of the present invention will be in the form of a pyrogen-free, parenterally 
acceptable aqueous solution. The preparation of such parenterally acceptable protein solutions, having due regard to 
pH, isotonicity, stability, and the like, is within the skill in the art. A preferred pharmaceutical composition for intravenous, 
cutaneous, or subcutaneous injection should contain, in addition to protein of the present invention, an isotonic vehicle 
such as Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Dextrose Injection, Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection, 
Lactated Ringer's Injection, or other vehicle as known in the art. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention 
may also contain stabilizers, preservatives, buffers, antioxidants, or other additives known to those of skill in the art. 
[0116] The amount of protein of the present invention in the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention will 
depend upon the nature and severity of the condition being treated, and on the nature of prior treatments which the 
patient has undergone. Ultimately, the attending physician will decide the amount of protein of the present invention with 
which to treat each individual patient. Initially, the attending physician will administer low doses of protein of the present 
invention and observe the patient's response. Larger doses of protein of the present invention may be administered until 
the optimal therapeutic effect is obtained for the patient, and at that point the dosage is not increased further. It is 
contemplated that the various pharmaceutical compositions used to practice the method of the present invention should 
contain about 0.01 Pg to about 100 mg (preferably about 0.1 ng to about 10 mg, more preferably about 0.1 Pg to about 
1 mg) of protein of the present invention per kg body weight.

[0117] The duration of intravenous therapy using the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention will vary, 
depending on the severity of the disease being treated and the condition and potential idiosyncratic response of each 
individual patient. It is contemplated that the duration of each application of the protein of the present invention will be 
in the range of 12 to 24 hours of continuous intravenous administration. Ultimately the attending physician will decide 
on the appropriate duration of intravenous therapy using the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. 
[0118] Protein of the invention may also be used to immunize animals to obtain polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies 
which specifically react with the protein. As used herein, the term "antibody" includes without limitation a polyclonal 
antibody, a monoclonal antibody, a chimeric antibody, a single-chain antibody, a CDR-grafted antibody, a humanized 
antibody, or fragments thereof which bind to the indicated protein. Such term also includes any other species derived 
from an antibody or antibody sequence which is capable of binding the indicated protein. 
[0119] Antibodies to a particular protein can be produced by methods well known to those skilled in the art. For example, 
monoclonal antibodies can be produced by generation of antibody-producing hybridomas in accordance with known 
methods (see for example, Goding, 1983, Monoclonal antibodies: principles and practice, Academic Press Inc., New 
York; and Yokoyama, 1992, "Production of Monoclonal Antibodies" in Current Protocols in Immunology, Unit 2.5, Greene 
Publishing Assoc. and John Wiley &amp; Sons). Polyclonal sera and antibodies can be produced by inoculation of a mammalian 
subject with the relevant protein or fragments thereof in accordance with known methods. Fragments of antibodies, 
receptors, or other reactive peptides can be produced from the corresponding antibodies by cleavage of and collection 
of the desired fragments in accordance with known methods (see for example, Goding, supra; and Andrew et al., 1992, 
"Fragmentation of Immunoglobulins" in Current Protocols in Immunology, Unit 2.8, Greene Publishing Assoc. and John 
Wiley &amp; Sons). Chimeric antibodies and single chain antibodies can also be produced in accordance with known recom-
binant methods (see for example, 5,169,939, 5,194,594, and 5,576,184). Humanized antibodies can also be made from 
corresponding murine antibodies in accordance with well known methods (see for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,530,101, 
5,585,089, and 5,693,762). Additionally, human antibodies may be produced in non-human animals such as mice that 
have been genetically altered to express human antibody molecules (see for example Fishwild et al., 1996, Nature 
Biotechnology 14: 845-851; Mendez et al., 1997, Nature Genetics 15: 146-156 (erratum Nature Genetics 16: 410); and 
U.S. Patents 5,877,397 and 5,625,126). Such antibodies may be obtained using either the entire protein or fragments 
thereof as an immunogen. The peptide immunogens additionally may contain a cysteine residue at the carboxyl terminus, 
and are conjugated to a hapten such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). Methods for synthesizing such peptides are 
known in the art, for example, as in R.P. Merrifield, J. Amer.Chem.Soc. 85, 2149-2154 (1963); J.L. Krstenansky, et al., 
FEBS Lett. 211, 10 (1987). 
[0120] Monoclonal antibodies binding to the protein of the invention may be useful diagnostic agents for the immun-
odetection of the protein. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies binding to the protein may also be useful therapeutics for 
both conditions associated with the protein and also in the treatment of some forms of cancer where abnormal expression 
of the protein is involved. In the case of cancerous cells or leukemic cells, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against 
the protein may be useful in detecting and preventing the metastatic spread of the cancerous cells, which may be 
mediated by the protein. 
[0121] For compositions of the present invention which are useful for bone, cartilage, tendon or ligament regeneration, 
the therapeutic method includes administering the composition topically, systematically, or locally as an implant or device. 
When administered, the therapeutic composition for use in this invention is, of course, in a pyrogen-free, physiologically 
acceptable form. Further, the composition may desirably be encapsulated or injected in a viscous form for delivery to 
the site of bone, cartilage or tissue damage. Topical administration may be suitable for wound healing and tissue repair. 
Therapeutically useful agents other than a protein of the invention which may also optionally be included in the composition 
as described above, may alternatively or additionally, be administered simultaneously or sequentially with the composition 
in the methods of the invention. Preferably for bone and/or cartilage formation, the composition would include a matrix 
capable of delivering the protein-containing composition to the site of bone and/or cartilage damage, providing a structure 
for the developing bone and cartilage and optimally capable of being resorbed into the body. Such matrices may be 
formed of materials presently in use for other implanted medical applications. 
[0122] The choice of matrix material is based on biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical properties, cosmetic 
appearance and interface properties. The particular application of the compositions will define the appropriate formulation. 
Potential matrices for the compositions may be biodegradable and chemically defined calcium sulfate, tricalciumphos-
phate, hydroxyapatite, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid and polyanhydrides. Other potential materials are biodegradable 
and biologically well-defined, such as bone or dermal collagen. Further matrices are comprised of pure proteins or 
extracellular matrix components. Other potential matrices are nonbiodegradable and chemically defined, such as sintered 
hydroxapatite, bioglass, aluminates, or other ceramics. Matrices may be comprised of combinations of any of the above 
mentioned types of material, such as polylactic acid and hydroxyapatite or collagen and tricalciumphosphate. The bioce-
ramics may be altered in composition, such as in calcium-aluminate-phosphate and processing to alter pore size, particle 
size, particle shape, and biodegradability. 
[0123] Presently preferred is a 50: 50 (mole weight) copolymer of lactic acid and glycolic acid in the form of porous 


EP 1 177 312 B1

particles having diameters ranging from 150 to 800 microns. In some applications, it will be useful to utilize a sequestering 
agent, such as carboxymethyl cellulose or autologous blood clot, to prevent the protein compositions from disassociating 
from the matrix. 
[0124] A preferred family of sequestering agents is cellulosic materials such as alkylcelluloses (including hydroxy-
alkylcelluloses), including methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypro-
pylmethylcellulose, and carboxymethylcellulose, the most preferred being cationic salts of carboxymethylcellulose 
(CMC). Other preferred sequestering agents include hyaluronic acid, sodium alginate, poly (ethylene glycol), polyoxyeth-
ylene oxide, carboxyvinyl polymer and poly (vinyl alcohol). The amount of sequestering agent useful herein is 0.5-20 
wt%, preferably 1-10 wt% based on total formulation weight, which represents the amount necessary to prevent desorbtion 
of the protein from the polymer matrix and to provide appropriate handling of the composition, yet not so much that the 
progenitor cells are prevented from infiltrating the matrix, thereby providing the protein the opportunity to assist the 
osteogenic activity of the progenitor cells. 
[0125] In further compositions, proteins of the invention may be combined with other agents beneficial to the treatment 
of the bone and/or cartilage defect, wound, or tissue in question. These agents include various growth factors such as 
epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factors (TGF-α and TGF-β), 
and insulin-like growth factor (IGF). 
[0126] The therapeutic compositions are also presently valuable for veterinary applications. Particularly domestic 
animals and thoroughbred horses, in addition to humans, are desired patients for such treatment with proteins of the 
present invention. 
[0127] The dosage regimen of a protein-containing pharmaceutical composition to be used in tissue regeneration will 
be determined by the attending physician considering various factors which modify the action of the proteins, e.g., amount 
of tissue weight desired to be formed, the site of damage, the condition of the damaged tissue, the size of a wound, type 
of damaged tissue (e.g., bone), the patient's age, sex, and diet, the severity of any infection, time of administration and 
other clinical factors. The dosage may vary with the type of matrix used in the reconstitution and with inclusion of other 
proteins in the pharmaceutical composition. For example, the addition of other known growth factors, such as IGF I 
(insulin like growth factor I), to the final composition, may also effect the dosage. Progress can be monitored by periodic 
assessment of tissue/ bone growth and/or repair, for example, X-rays, histomorphometric determinations and tetracycline 
labeling. 
[0128] Polynucleotides of the present invention can also be used for gene therapy. Such polynucleotides can be 
introduced either in vivo or ex vivo into cells for expression in a mammalian subject. Polynucleotides of the invention 
may also be administered by other known methods for introduction of nucleic acid into a cell or organism (including, 
without limitation, in the form of viral vectors or naked DNA). 
[0129] Cells may also be cultured ex vivo in the presence of proteins of the present invention in order to proliferate or 
to produce a desired effect on or activity in such cells. Treated cells can then be introduced in vivo for therapeutic purposes. 
[0130] This invention is further illustrated by the following examples which should not be construed as limiting. The 
contents of the Sequence Listing is incorporated herein. 

EXAMPLES 

Identification and characterization of clone "hGIL-19/AE289" 

[0131] A polynucleotide of the present invention has been identified as clone "hGIL-19/AE289". Clone hGIL-19/AE289 
was isolated according to the following method. A murine EST was identified from a murine cDNA library made from 
splenocytes activated with both ConA and bone marrow derived dendritic cells. The EST was identified using methods 
which are selective for cDNAs encoding secreted proteins (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,536,637). The murine EST sequence 
was used to isolate a full-length murine clone from the same cDNA library. Analysis of the sequence of the murine clone 
revealed a significant homology to interleukin-10 (IL-10). 
[0132] In order to isolate a human homolog of the murine clone, PCR primers were constructed based upon the region 
of the murine sequence which showed homology to IL-10. Use of such primers for amplification in a human PBMC library 
produced a PCR product of significant size. Analysis of the sequence of the PCR product confirmed that it was a homolog 
of the murine cDNA. Oligonucleotides were constructed from the sequence of the partial human clone and used to isolate 
a full-length human clone from the PBMC library. 
[0133] hGIL-19/AE289 is a full-length human clone, including the entire coding sequence of a secreted protein (also 
referred to herein as "hGIL-19/AE289" protein). Analysis of its amino acid sequence indicated that it has about 23% 
homology to hIL-10. Based on the putative receptor-binding motifs in IL-10, three motifs involved with analogous function 
have been proposed in hGIL-19/AE289 through computer modeling. These are the regions of SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 
50 to 60, from residue 63 to 81, and from residue 168 to 177. Analyses of databases revealed that hGIL-19 also exhibits 
similar levels of homology with IL-10 of other species.

[0134] The nucleotide sequence of hGIL-19/AE289 as presently determined is reported in SEQ ID NO: 1, and includes 
a poly (A) tail. The amino acid sequence of the hGIL-19/AE289 protein corresponding to the foregoing nucleotide sequence 
is reported in SEQ ID NO: 2. 

Characterization of hGIL-19/AE289 protein 

[0135] Cell lines which stably express and secrete full length hGIL-19/AE289 protein were created by transfecting 
CHO cells with hGIL-19/AE289 cDNA in appropriate expression vectors. Transiently transfected COS cells using ap-
propriate hGIL-19/AE289 expression vectors have been used to make hGIL-19/AE289 protein for analysis. Transfections 
were accomplished using the commercially available Lipofectamine reagent (Gibco). Interestingly, COS cells which 
express hGIL-19 were observed to non-uniformly detach, forming holes in the cell culture monolayer. Media conditioned 
by transfected COS cells was used to demonstrate cytokine-like activity of hGIL-19/AE289 protein. Western blot analysis 
of cell lysates showed that Stat-3 becomes phosphorylated (activated) in a kidney mesangial tissue-derived cell line-
exhibiting macrophage-like qualities (MES-13; see, Dumoutier et al (2000) J. of Immunology 164: 1814-1819) upon 
exposure of that cell to media conditioned by hGIL-19/AE289-expressing cells. In addition phosphorylation of Stat-3 is 
induced in non-transfected COS cells that are treated with hGIL-19 protein. 
[0136] Electrophoretic analysis of hGIL-19/AE289 protein (derived from the transfected COS cell lines described 
herein) indicated that the expressed protein exists in a range of sizes. Treatment of COS-derived hGIL-19 protein with 
N-glycanase prior to electrophoresis results in a single band corresponding to the highest mobility (e.g. lowest molecular 
weight) species seen in untreated hGIL-19/AE289. This is consistent with proposed glycosylation events which may 
occur at the putative N-linked glycosylation sites identified in the amino acid sequence of hGIL-19/AE289 (amino acid 
residues 54-56, 68-70, 97-99, and 176-178 of SEQ ID NO: 2). 
[0137] Edman N-terminal sequencing determined that the N-terminus of the mature hGIL-19/AE289 protein begins 
with the residue at position 34 of SEQ ID NO: 2 (alanine). Expression vectors were created which fuse a "6x histidine" 
affinity tag and a FLAG epitope tag to the N-terminus of the mature hGIL-19/AE289 protein. (The added amino acid tag 
is given in SEQ ID NO: 3 and has the following amino acid sequence: 

MKFLVNVALVFMVVYISYIYAGSGHHHHHHGSGDYKDDDDKAPISSHCR). 

These tagged constructs were used to create stably expressing CHO cell lines and transiently expressing COS cell 
lines. The tags provided a convenient means for detecting hGIL-19/AE289 (e.g., anti-6xhis antibodies; anti-FLAG anti-
bodies), and for purifying the protein from conditioned media (using Ni +2 resin). Human GIL-19 protein purified by this 
tag from the hGIL-19/AE289-expressing COS cell lines could used to induce Stat-3 activation in MES-13 cells. 
[0138] Comparison of hGIL-19 mRNA transcripts in activated Th1 and Th2 cells (see, for example, Syrbe et al, (1999) 
Springer Seminars in Immunopathology, 21: 263-85) indicated a substantially higher level of expression of GIL-19 in 
activated Th1 cells than in activated Th2 cells. Analysis of GIL-19 mRNA was accomplished with RNAse protection assays. 

Immunological effects GIL-19 

[0139] The immunological effects of GIL-19 were investigated in a metazoan context by viral introduction of the cDNA 
of murine GIL-19 into mice. An adenoviral vector was used to express a cDNA of murine GIL-19 in 8 week old C57/B6 
female mice by injection of 5x10 10 viral particles. Test mice were sacrificed at 7 and 14 days after injection and compared 
with control mice injected with buffer only or with adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). At days 7 and 
14, it was noted that the absolute and relative thymic weights were significantly decreased in the mice which expressed 
the viral murine GIL-19. Absolute mean weight of the spleen was decreased on day 14 and liver weights were slightly 
increased on day 7. A gross generalized atrophy of the thymus as well as lymphoid depletion (observed microscopically) 
was apparent on days 7 and 14. 
[0140] In addition, there were a number of hematological effects that were apparent on day 7, including decreased 
red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. These effects, taken together, indicated anemia in the animals. Fur-
thermore, there was an increase in platelets as well as an increase in the white blood cell count due to an increase of 
neutrophils. In light of these observations there was no evidence of a regenerative response, which indicated that the 
effects may be at the level of the bone marrow. 
[0141] Furthermore, there was a slight decrease in Albumin levels at day 7 and day 14. A possible cause for this is 
the loss of small molecules through the kidney or gut.
